so much the better it will save me a world of trouble and economy had it been your uncles doing i must and _would_ have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way i shall offer to pay him tomorrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter  he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading mr collinss letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to gosaying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure  elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hours quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer anything material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time  when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she followed her and made the important communication its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself  good gracious! lord bless me! only think! dear me! mr darcy! who would have thought it! and is it really true? oh! my sweetest lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! what pinmoney what jewels what carriages you will have! janes is nothing to itnothing at all i am so pleasedso happy such a charming man!so handsome! so tall!oh my dear lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before i hope he will overlook it dear dear lizzy a house in town! every thing that is charming! three daughters married! ten thousand a year! oh lord! what will become of me i shall go distracted  this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her  my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else! ten thousand a year and very likely more! tis as good as a lord! and a special licence you must and shall be married by a special licence but my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it tomorrow  this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended soninlaw that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion  elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem  i admire all my three sonsinlaw highly said he wickham perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well as janes    chapter 60   elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her how could you begin? said she i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place?  i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i _had_ begun  my beauty you had early withstood and as for my mannersmy behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence?  for the liveliness of your mind i did  you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for _your_ approbation alone i roused and interested you because i was so unlike _them_ had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you therei have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable to be sure you knew no actual good of mebut nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love  was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield?  dearest jane! who could have done less for her? but make a virtue of it by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here? why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me?  because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement  but i was embarrassed  and so was i  you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner  a man who had felt less might  how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it! but i wonder how long you _would_ have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you _would_ have spoken if i had not asked you! my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect _too much_ i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise? for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do  you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours my aunts intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing  lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for? was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?  my real purpose was to see _you_ and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made  shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her?  i am more likely to want more time than courage elizabeth but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly  and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected  from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy had been overrated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiners long letter but now having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows  i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write you supposed more than really existed but _now_ suppose as much as you choose give a loose rein to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes how could i be so silly as to wish it! your idea of the ponies is delightful we will go round the park every day i am the happiest creature in the world perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh mr darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me you are all to come to pemberley at christmas yours etc  mr darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr bennet sent to mr collins in reply to his last  dear sir  i must trouble you once more for congratulations elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr darcy console lady catherine as well as you can but if i were you i would stand by the nephew he has more to give  yours sincerely etc  miss bingleys congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved  the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brothers in sending it four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister  before any answer could arrive from mr collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband he bore it however with admirable calmness he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st jamess with very decent composure if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight  mrs phillipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs phillips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys good humour encouraged yet whenever she _did_ speak she must be vulgar nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley    chapter 61   happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable wellinformed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly  mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected  mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper or _her_ affectionate heart the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other  kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid from the further disadvantage of lydias society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going  mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennets being quite unable to sit alone mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance  as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished the letter was to this effect  my dear lizzy  i wish you joy if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr darcy about it if you had rather not  yours etc  as it happened that elizabeth had _much_ rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought his affection for her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her  though darcy could never receive _him_ at pemberley yet for elizabeths sake he assisted him further in his profession lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingleys good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone  miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth  pemberley was now georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see they were able to love each other even as well as they intended georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way by elizabeths instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself  lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end but at length by elizabeths persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city  with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them      end of the project gutenberg ebook of pride and prejudice by jane
