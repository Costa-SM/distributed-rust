 remaining till after supper  unless when some barbarous neighbour  who could not be enough detested  had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept   elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister  for while he was present  jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else  but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur  in the absence of jane  he always attached himself to elizabeth  for the pleasure of talking of her  and when bingley was gone  jane constantly sought the same means of relief    he has made me so happy   said she  one evening   by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring  i had not believed it possible     i suspected as much   replied elizabeth   but how did he account for it     it must have been his sister s doing  they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me  which i cannot wonder at  since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects  but when they see  as i trust they will  that their brother is happy with me  they will learn to be contented  and we shall be on good terms again  though we can never be what we once were to each other     that is the most unforgiving speech   said elizabeth   that i ever heard you utter  good girl  it would vex me  indeed  to see you again the dupe of miss bingley s pretended regard     would you believe it  lizzy  that when he went to town last november  he really loved me  and nothing but a persuasion of  my  being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again     he made a little mistake to be sure  but it is to the credit of his modesty    this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence  and the little value he put on his own good qualities  elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend  for  though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world  she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him    i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed   cried jane   oh  lizzy  why am i thus singled from my family  and blessed above them all  if i could but see  you  as happy  if there  were  but such another man for you     if you were to give me forty such men  i never could be so happy as you  till i have your disposition  your goodness  i never can have your happiness  no  no  let me shift for myself  and  perhaps  if i have very good luck  i may meet with another mr  collins in time    the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret  mrs  bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs  phillips  and she ventured  without any permission  to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton   the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world  though only a few weeks before  when lydia had first run away  they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune     chapter 56   one morning  about a week after bingley s engagement with jane had been formed  as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room  their attention was suddenly drawn to the window  by the sound of a carriage  and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn  it was too early in the morning for visitors  and besides  the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours  the horses were post  and neither the carriage  nor the livery of the servant who preceded it  were familiar to them  as it was certain  however  that somebody was coming  bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion  and walk away with him into the shrubbery  they both set off  and the conjectures of the remaining three continued  though with little satisfaction  till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered  it was lady catherine de bourgh   they were of course all intending to be surprised  but their astonishment was beyond their expectation  and on the part of mrs  bennet and kitty  though she was perfectly unknown to them  even inferior to what elizabeth felt   she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious  made no other reply to elizabeth s salutation than a slight inclination of the head  and sat down without saying a word  elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship s entrance  though no request of introduction had been made   mrs  bennet  all amazement  though flattered by having a guest of such high importance  received her with the utmost politeness  after sitting for a moment in silence  she said very stiffly to elizabeth    i hope you are well  miss bennet  that lady  i suppose  is your mother    elizabeth replied very concisely that she was    and  that  i suppose is one of your sisters     yes  madam   said mrs  bennet  delighted to speak to lady catherine   she is my youngest girl but one  my youngest of all is lately married  and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds  walking with a young man who  i believe  will soon become a part of the family     you have a very small park here   returned lady catherine after a short silence    it is nothing in comparison of rosings  my lady  i dare say  but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas s     this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening  in summer  the windows are full west    mrs  bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner  and then added    may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr  and mrs  collins well     yes  very well  i saw them the night before last    elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte  as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling  but no letter appeared  and she was completely puzzled   mrs  bennet  with great civility  begged her ladyship to take some refreshment  but lady catherine very resolutely  and not very politely  declined eating anything  and then  rising up  said to elizabeth    miss bennet  there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn  i should be glad to take a turn in it  if you will favour me with your company     go  my dear   cried her mother   and show her ladyship about the different walks  i think she will be pleased with the hermitage    elizabeth obeyed  and running into her own room for her parasol  attended her noble guest downstairs  as they passed through the hall  lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room  and pronouncing them  after a short survey  to be decent looking rooms  walked on   her carriage remained at the door  and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it  they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse  elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable    how could i ever think her like her nephew   said she  as she looked in her face   as soon as they entered the copse  lady catherine began in the following manner      you can be at no loss  miss bennet  to understand the reason of my journey hither  your own heart  your own conscience  must tell you why i come    elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment    indeed  you are mistaken  madam  i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here     miss bennet   replied her ladyship  in an angry tone   you ought to know  that i am not to be trifled with  but however insincere  you  may choose to be  you shall not find  me  so  my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness  and in a cause of such moment as this  i shall certainly not depart from it  a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago  i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married  but that you  that miss elizabeth bennet  would  in all likelihood  be soon afterwards united to my nephew  my own nephew  mr  darcy  though i  know  it must be a scandalous falsehood  though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible  i instantly resolved on setting off for this place  that i might make my sentiments known to you     if you believed it impossible to be true   said elizabeth  colouring with astonishment and disdain   i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far  what could your ladyship propose by it     at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted     your coming to longbourn  to see me and my family   said elizabeth coolly   will be rather a confirmation of it  if  indeed  such a report is in existence     if  do you then pretend to be ignorant of it  has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves  do you not know that such a report is spread abroad     i never heard that it was     and can you likewise declare  that there is no foundation for it     i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship  you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer     this is not to be borne  miss bennet  i insist on being satisfied  has he  has my nephew  made you an offer of marriage     your ladyship has declared it to be impossible     it ought to be so  it must be so  while he retains the use of his reason  but your arts and allurements may  in a moment of infatuation  have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family  you may have drawn him in     if i have  i shall be the last person to confess it     miss bennet  do you know who i am  i have not been accustomed to such language as this  i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world  and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns     but you are not entitled to know mine  nor will such behaviour as this  ever induce me to be explicit     let me be rightly understood  this match  to which you have the presumption to aspire  can never take place  no  never  mr  darcy is engaged to my daughter  now what have you to say     only this  that if he is so  you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me    lady catherine hesitated for a moment  and then replied    the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind  from their infancy  they have been intended for each other  it was the favourite wish of  his  mother  as well as of hers  while in their cradles  we planned the union  and now  at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage  to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth  of no importance in the world  and wholly unallied to the family  do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends  to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh  are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy  have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin     yes  and i had heard it before  but what is that to me  if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew  i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh  you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage  its completion depended on others  if mr  darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin  why is not he to make another choice  and if i am that choice  why may not i accept him     because honour  decorum  prudence  nay  interest  forbid it  yes  miss bennet  interest  for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends  if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all  you will be censured  slighted  and despised  by everyone connected with him  your alliance will be a disgrace  your name will never even be mentioned by any of us     these are heavy misfortunes   replied elizabeth   but the wife of mr  darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation  that she could  upon the whole  have no cause to repine     obstinate  headstrong girl  i am ashamed of you  is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring  is nothing due to me on that score  let us sit down  you are to understand  miss bennet  that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose  nor will i be dissuaded from it  i have not been used to submit to any person s whims  i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment      that  will make your ladyship s situation at present more pitiable  but it will have no effect on me     i will not be interrupted  hear me in silence  my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other  they are descended  on the maternal side  from the same noble line  and  on the father s  from respectable  honourable  and ancient  though untitled  families  their fortune on both sides is splendid  they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses  and what is to divide them  the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family  connections  or fortune  is this to be endured  but it must not  shall not be  if you were sensible of your own good  you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up     in marrying your nephew  i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere  he is a gentleman  i am a gentleman s daughter  so far we are equal     true  you  are  a gentleman s daughter  but who was your mother  who are your uncles and aunts  do not imagine me ignorant of their condition     whatever my connections may be   said elizabeth   if your nephew does not object to them  they can be nothing to  you      tell me once for all  are you engaged to him    though elizabeth would not  for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine  have answered this question  she could not but say  after a moment s deliberation    i am not    lady catherine seemed pleased    and will you promise me  never to enter into such an engagement     i will make no promise of the kind     miss bennet i am shocked and astonished  i expected to find a more reasonable young woman  but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede  i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require     and i certainly  never  shall give it  i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable  your ladyship wants mr  darcy to marry your daughter  but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable  supposing him to be attached to me  would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin  allow me to say  lady catherine  that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged  you have widely mistaken my character  if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these  how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs  i cannot tell  but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine  i must beg  therefore  to be importuned no farther on the subject     not so hasty  if you please  i have by no means done  to all the objections i have already urged  i have still another to add  i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s infamous elopement  i know it all  that the young man s marrying her was a patched up business  at the expence of your father and uncles  and is such a girl to be my nephew s sister  is her husband  is the son of his late father s steward  to be his brother  heaven and earth   of what are you thinking  are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted     you can now have nothing further to say   she resentfully answered   you have insulted me in every possible method  i must beg to return to the house    and she rose as she spoke  lady catherine rose also  and they turned back  her ladyship was highly incensed    you have no regard  then  for the honour and credit of my nephew  unfeeling  selfish girl  do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody     lady catherine  i have nothing further to say  you know my sentiments     you are then resolved to have him     i have said no such thing  i am only resolved to act in that manner  which will  in my own opinion  constitute my happiness  without reference to  you   or to any person so wholly unconnected with me     it is well  you refuse  then  to oblige me  you refuse to obey the claims of duty  honour  and gratitude  you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends  and make him the contempt of the world     neither duty  nor honour  nor gratitude   replied elizabeth   have any possible claim on me  in the present instance  no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr  darcy  and with regard to the resentment of his family  or the indignation of the world  if the former  were  excited by his marrying me  it would not give me one moment s concern  and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn     and this is your real opinion  this is your final resolve  very well  i shall now know how to act  do not imagine  miss bennet  that your ambition will ever be gratified  i came to try you  i hoped to find you reasonable  but  depend upon it  i will carry my point    in this manner lady catherine talked on  till they were at the door of the carriage  when  turning hastily round  she added   i take no leave of you  miss bennet  i send no compliments to your mother  you deserve no such attention  i am most seriously displeased    elizabeth made no answer  and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house  walked quietly into it herself  she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs  her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room  to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself    she did not choose it   said her daughter   she would go     she is a very fine looking woman  and her calling here was prodigiously civil  for she only came  i suppose  to tell us the collinses were well  she is on her road somewhere  i dare say  and so  passing through meryton  thought she might as well call on you  i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you  lizzy    elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here  for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible     chapter 57   the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into  could not be easily overcome  nor could she  for many hours  learn to think of it less than incessantly  lady catherine  it appeared  had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings  for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr  darcy  it was a rational scheme  to be sure  but from what the report of their engagement could originate  elizabeth was at a loss to imagine  till she recollected that  his  being the intimate friend of bingley  and  her  being the sister of jane  was enough  at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another  to supply the idea  she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together  and her neighbours at lucas lodge  therefore  for through their communication with the collinses  the report  she concluded  had reached lady catherine   had only set that down as almost certain and immediate  which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time   in revolving lady catherine s expressions  however  she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference  from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage  it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew  and how  he  might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her  she dared not pronounce  she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt  or his dependence on her judgment  but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than  she  could do  and it was certain that  in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with  one   whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own  his aunt would address him on his weakest side  with his notions of dignity  he would probably feel that the arguments  which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous  contained much good sense and solid reasoning   if he had been wavering before as to what he should do  which had often seemed likely  the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt  and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him  in that case he would return no more  lady catherine might see him in her way through town  and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way    if  therefore  an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days   she added   i shall know how to understand it  i shall then give over every expectation  every wish of his constancy  if he is satisfied with only regretting me  when he might have obtained my affections and hand  i shall soon cease to regret him at all                              * * * * *  the surprise of the rest of the family  on hearing who their visitor had been  was very great  but they obligingly satisfied it  with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs  bennet s curiosity  and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject   the next morning  as she was going downstairs  she was met by her father  who came out of his library with a letter in his hand    lizzy   said he   i was going to look for you  come into my room    she followed him thither  and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held  it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine  and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations   she followed her father to the fire place  and they both sat down  he then said    i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly  as it principally concerns yourself  you ought to know its contents  i did not know before  that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony  let me congratulate you on a very important conquest    the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew  instead of the aunt  and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all  or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself  when her father continued    you look conscious  young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these  but i think i may defy even  your  sagacity  to discover the name of your admirer  this letter is from mr  collins     from mr  collins  and what can  he  have to say     something very much to the purpose of course  he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter  of which  it seems  he has been told by some of the good natured  gossiping lucases  i shall not sport with your impatience  by reading what he says on that point  what relates to yourself  is as follows   having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs  collins and myself on this happy event  let me now add a short hint on the subject of another  of which we have been advertised by the same authority  your daughter elizabeth  it is presumed  will not long bear the name of bennet  after her elder sister has resigned it  and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land     can you possibly guess  lizzy  who is meant by this   this young gentleman is blessed  in a peculiar way  with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire   splendid property  noble kindred  and extensive patronage  yet in spite of all these temptations  let me warn my cousin elizabeth  and yourself  of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals  which  of course  you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of     have you any idea  lizzy  who this gentleman is  but now it comes out     my motive for cautioning you is as follows  we have reason to imagine that his aunt  lady catherine de bourgh  does not look on the match with a friendly eye      mr  darcy   you see  is the man  now  lizzy  i think i  have  surprised you  could he  or the lucases  have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance  whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related  mr  darcy  who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish  and who probably never looked at you in his life  it is admirable    elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry  but could only force one most reluctant smile  never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her    are you not diverted     oh  yes  pray read on      after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night  she immediately  with her usual condescension  expressed what she felt on the occasion  when it became apparent  that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin  she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match  i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin  that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about  and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned   mr  collins moreover adds   i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up  and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known  i must not  however  neglect the duties of my station  or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married  it was an encouragement of vice  and had i been the rector of longbourn  i should very strenuously have opposed it  you ought certainly to forgive them  as a christian  but never to admit them in your sight  or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing   that is his notion of christian forgiveness  the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation  and his expectation of a young olive branch  but  lizzy  you look as if you did not enjoy it  you are not going to be  missish   i hope  and pretend to be affronted at an idle report  for what do we live  but to make sport for our neighbours  and laugh at them in our turn     oh   cried elizabeth   i am excessively diverted  but it is so strange     yes   that  is what makes it amusing  had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing  but  his  perfect indifference  and  your  pointed dislike  make it so delightfully absurd  much as i abominate writing  i would not give up mr  collins s correspondence for any consideration  nay  when i read a letter of his  i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham  much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law  and pray  lizzy  what said lady catherine about this report  did she call to refuse her consent    to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh  and as it had been asked without the least suspicion  she was not distressed by his repeating it  elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not  it was necessary to laugh  when she would rather have cried  her father had most cruelly mortified her  by what he said of mr  darcy s indifference  and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration  or fear that perhaps  instead of his seeing too little  she might have fancied too much     chapter 58   instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend  as elizabeth half expected mr  bingley to do  he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit  the gentlemen arrived early  and  before mrs  bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt  of which her daughter sat in momentary dread  bingley  who wanted to be alone with jane  proposed their all walking out  it was agreed to  mrs  bennet was not in the habit of walking  mary could never spare time  but the remaining five set off together  bingley and jane  however  soon allowed the others to outstrip them  they lagged behind  while elizabeth  kitty  and darcy were to entertain each other  very little was said by either  kitty was too much afraid of him to talk  elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution  and perhaps he might be doing the same   they walked towards the lucases  because kitty wished to call upon maria  and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern  when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone  now was the moment for her resolution to be executed  and  while her courage was high  she immediately said    mr  darcy  i am a very selfish creature  and  for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings  care not how much i may be wounding yours  i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister  ever since i have known it  i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it  were it known to the rest of my family  i should not have merely my own gratitude to express     i am sorry  exceedingly sorry   replied darcy  in a tone of surprise and emotion   that you have ever been informed of what may  in a mistaken light  have given you uneasiness  i did not think mrs  gardiner was so little to be trusted     you must not blame my aunt  lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter  and  of course  i could not rest till i knew the particulars  let me thank you again and again  in the name of all my family  for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble  and bear so many mortifications  for the sake of discovering them     if you  will  thank me   he replied   let it be for yourself alone  that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on  i shall not attempt to deny  but your  family  owe me nothing  much as i respect them  i believe i thought only of  you     elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word  after a short pause  her companion added   you are too generous to trifle with me  if your feelings are still what they were last april  tell me so at once   my  affections and wishes are unchanged  but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever    elizabeth  feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation  now forced herself to speak  and immediately  though not very fluently  gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change  since the period to which he alluded  as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances  the happiness which this reply produced  was such as he had probably never felt before  and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do  had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye  she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight  diffused over his face  became him  but  though she could not look  she could listen  and he told her of feelings  which  in proving of what importance she was to him  made his affection every moment more valuable   they walked on  without knowing in what direction  there was too much to be thought  and felt  and said  for attention to any other objects  she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt  who did call on him in her return through london  and there relate her journey to longbourn  its motive  and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth  dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which  in her ladyship s apprehension  peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance  in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give  but  unluckily for her ladyship  its effect had been exactly contrariwise    it taught me to hope   said he   as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before  i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that  had you been absolutely  irrevocably decided against me  you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine  frankly and openly    elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied   yes  you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of  that   after abusing you so abominably to your face  i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations     what did you say of me  that i did not deserve  for  though your accusations were ill founded  formed on mistaken premises  my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof  it was unpardonable  i cannot think of it without abhorrence     we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening   said elizabeth   the conduct of neither  if strictly examined  will be irreproachable  but since then  we have both  i hope  improved in civility     i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself  the recollection of what i then said  of my conduct  my manners  my expressions during the whole of it  is now  and has been many months  inexpressibly painful to me  your reproof  so well applied  i shall never forget   had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner   those were your words  you know not  you can scarcely conceive  how they have tortured me   though it was some time  i confess  before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice     i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression  i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way     i can easily believe it  you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling  i am sure you did  the turn of your countenance i shall never forget  as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me     oh  do not repeat what i then said  these recollections will not do at all  i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it    darcy mentioned his letter   did it   said he   did it soon make you think better of me  did you  on reading it  give any credit to its contents    she explained what its effect on her had been  and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed    i knew   said he   that what i wrote must give you pain  but it was necessary  i hope you have destroyed the letter  there was one part especially  the opening of it  which i should dread your having the power of reading again  i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me     the letter shall certainly be burnt  if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard  but  though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable  they are not  i hope  quite so easily changed as that implies     when i wrote that letter   replied darcy   i believed myself perfectly calm and cool  but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit     the letter  perhaps  began in bitterness  but it did not end so  the adieu is charity itself  but think no more of the letter  the feelings of the person who wrote  and the person who received it  are now so widely different from what they were then  that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten  you must learn some of my philosophy  think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure     i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind  your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach  that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy  but  what is much better  of innocence  but with me  it is not so  painful recollections will intrude which cannot  which ought not  to be repelled  i have been a selfish being all my life  in practice  though not in principle  as a child i was taught what was right  but i was not taught to correct my temper  i was given good principles  but left to follow them in pride and conceit  unfortunately an only son  for many years an only child   i was spoilt by my parents  who  though good themselves  my father  particularly  all that was benevolent and amiable   allowed  encouraged  almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing  to care for none beyond my own family circle  to think meanly of all the rest of the world  to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own  such i was  from eight to eight and twenty  and such i might still have been but for you  dearest  loveliest elizabeth  what do i not owe you  you taught me a lesson  hard indeed at first  but most advantageous  by you  i was properly humbled  i came to you without a doubt of my reception  you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased     had you then persuaded yourself that i should     indeed i had  what will you think of my vanity  i believed you to be wishing  expecting my addresses     my manners must have been in fault  but not intentionally  i assure you  i never meant to deceive you  but my spirits might often lead me wrong  how you must have hated me after  that  evening     hate you  i was angry perhaps at first  but my anger soon began to take a proper direction     i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me  when we met at pemberley  you blamed me for coming     no indeed  i felt nothing but surprise     your surprise could not be greater than  mine  in being noticed by you  my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness  and i confess that i did not expect to receive  more  than my due     my object then   replied darcy   was to show you  by every civility in my power  that i was not so mean as to resent the past  and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness  to lessen your ill opinion  by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to  how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell  but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you    he then told her of georgiana s delight in her acquaintance  and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption  which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption  she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn  and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend   she expressed her gratitude again  but it was too painful a subject to each  to be dwelt on farther   after walking several miles in a leisurely manner  and too busy to know anything about it  they found at last  on examining their watches  that it was time to be at home    what could become of mr  bingley and jane   was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs  darcy was delighted with their engagement  his friend had given him the earliest information of it    i must ask whether you were surprised   said elizabeth    not at all  when i went away  i felt that it would soon happen     that is to say  you had given your permission  i guessed as much   and though he exclaimed at the term  she found that it had been pretty much the case    on the evening before my going to london   said he   i made a confession to him  which i believe i ought to have made long ago  i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent  his surprise was great  he had never had the slightest suspicion  i told him  moreover  that i believed myself mistaken in supposing  as i had done  that your sister was indifferent to him  and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated  i felt no doubt of their happiness together    elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend    did you speak from your own observation   said she   when you told him that my sister loved him  or merely from my information last spring     from the former  i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made here  and i was convinced of her affection     and your assurance of it  i suppose  carried immediate conviction to him     it did  bingley is most unaffectedly modest  his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case  but his reliance on mine made every thing easy  i was obliged to confess one thing  which for a time  and not unjustly  offended him  i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter  that i had known it  and purposely kept it from him  he was angry  but his anger  i am persuaded  lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments  he has heartily forgiven me now    elizabeth longed to observe that mr  bingley had been a most delightful friend  so easily guided that his worth was invaluable  but she checked herself  she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at  and it was rather too early to begin  in anticipating the happiness of bingley  which of course was to be inferior only to his own  he continued the conversation till they reached the house  in the hall they parted     chapter 59    my dear lizzy  where can you have been walking to   was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered their room  and from all the others when they sat down to table  she had only to say in reply  that they had wandered about  till she was beyond her own knowledge  she coloured as she spoke  but neither that  nor anything else  awakened a suspicion of the truth   the evening passed quietly  unmarked by anything extraordinary  the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed  the unacknowledged were silent  darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth  and elizabeth  agitated and confused  rather  knew  that she was happy than  felt  herself to be so  for  besides the immediate embarrassment  there were other evils before her  she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known  she was aware that no one liked him but jane  and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away   at night she opened her heart to jane  though suspicion was very far from miss bennet s general habits  she was absolutely incredulous here    you are joking  lizzy  this cannot be   engaged to mr  darcy  no  no  you shall not deceive me  i know it to be impossible     this is a wretched beginning indeed  my sole dependence was on you  and i am sure nobody else will believe me  if you do not  yet  indeed  i am in earnest  i speak nothing but the truth  he still loves me  and we are engaged    jane looked at her doubtingly   oh  lizzy  it cannot be  i know how much you dislike him     you know nothing of the matter   that  is all to be forgot  perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now  but in such cases as these  a good memory is unpardonable  this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself    miss bennet still looked all amazement  elizabeth again  and more seriously assured her of its truth    good heaven  can it be really so  yet now i must believe you   cried jane   my dear  dear lizzy  i would  i do congratulate you  but are you certain  forgive the question  are you quite certain that you can be happy with him     there can be no doubt of that  it is settled between us already  that we are to be the happiest couple in the world  but are you pleased  jane  shall you like to have such a brother     very  very much  nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight  but we considered it  we talked of it as impossible  and do you really love him quite well enough  oh  lizzy  do anything rather than marry without affection  are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do     oh  yes  you will only think i feel  more  than i ought to do  when i tell you all     what do you mean     why  i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley  i am afraid you will be angry     my dearest sister  now  be  serious  i want to talk very seriously  let me know every thing that i am to know  without delay  will you tell me how long you have loved him     it has been coming on so gradually  that i hardly know when it began  but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley    another entreaty that she would be serious  however  produced the desired effect  and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment  when convinced on that article  miss bennet had nothing further to wish    now i am quite happy   said she   for you will be as happy as myself  i always had a value for him  were it for nothing but his love of you  i must always have esteemed him  but now  as bingley s friend and your husband  there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me  but lizzy  you have been very sly  very reserved with me  how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton  i owe all that i know of it to another  not to you    elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy  she had been unwilling to mention bingley  and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend  but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia s marriage  all was acknowledged  and half the night spent in conversation                             * * * * *   good gracious   cried mrs  bennet  as she stood at a window the next morning   if that disagreeable mr  darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley  what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here  i had no notion but he would go a shooting  or something or other  and not disturb us with his company  what shall we do with him  lizzy  you must walk out with him again  that he may not be in bingley s way    elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal  yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet   as soon as they entered  bingley looked at her so expressively  and shook hands with such warmth  as left no doubt of his good information  and he soon afterwards said aloud   mrs  bennet  have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day     i advise mr  darcy  and lizzy  and kitty   said mrs  bennet   to walk to oakham mount this morning  it is a nice long walk  and mr  darcy has never seen the view     it may do very well for the others   replied mr  bingley   but i am sure it will be too much for kitty  won t it  kitty   kitty owned that she had rather stay at home  darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount  and elizabeth silently consented  as she went up stairs to get ready  mrs  bennet followed her  saying    i am quite sorry  lizzy  that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself  but i hope you will not mind it  it is all for jane s sake  you know  and there is no occasion for talking to him  except just now and then  so  do not put yourself to inconvenience    during their walk  it was resolved that mr  bennet s consent should be asked in the course of the evening  elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother s  she could not determine how her mother would take it  sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man  but whether she were violently set against the match  or violently delighted with it  it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense  and she could no more bear that mr  darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy  than the first vehemence of her disapprobation                             * * * * *  in the evening  soon after mr  bennet withdrew to the library  she saw mr  darcy rise also and follow him  and her agitation on seeing it was extreme  she did not fear her father s opposition  but he was going to be made unhappy  and that it should be through her means  that  she   his favourite child  should be distressing him by her choice  should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her  was a wretched reflection  and she sat in misery till mr  darcy appeared again  when  looking at him  she was a little relieved by his smile  in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty  and  while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper   go to your father  he wants you in the library   she was gone directly   her father was walking about the room  looking grave and anxious   lizzy   said he   what are you doing  are you out of your senses  to be accepting this man  have not you always hated him    how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable  her expressions more moderate  it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give  but they were now necessary  and she assured him  with some confusion  of her attachment to mr  darcy    or  in other words  you are determined to have him  he is rich  to be sure  and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane  but will they make you happy     have you any other objection   said elizabeth   than your belief of my indifference     none at all  we all know him to be a proud  unpleasant sort of man  but this would be nothing if you really liked him     i do  i do like him   she replied  with tears in her eyes   i love him  indeed he has no improper pride  he is perfectly amiable  you do not know what he really is  then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms     lizzy   said her father   i have given him my consent  he is the kind of man  indeed  to whom i should never dare refuse anything  which he condescended to ask  i now give it to  you   if you are resolved on having him  but let me advise you to think better of it  i know your disposition  lizzy  i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable  unless you truly esteemed your husband  unless you looked up to him as a superior  your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage  you could scarcely escape discredit and misery  my child  let me not have the grief of seeing  you  unable to respect your partner in life  you know not what you are about    elizabeth  still more affected  was earnest and solemn in her reply  and at length  by repeated assurances that mr  darcy was really the object of her choice  by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone  relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day  but had stood the test of many months  suspense  and enumerating with energy all his good qualities  she did conquer her father s incredulity  and reconcile him to the match    well  my dear   said he  when she ceased speaking   i have no more to say  if this be the case  he deserves you  i could not have parted with you  my lizzy  to anyone less worthy    to complete the favourable impression  she then told him what mr  darcy had voluntarily done for lydia  he heard her with astonishment    this is an evening of wonders  indeed  and so  darcy did every thing  made up the match  gave the money  paid the fellow s debts  and got him his commission  so much the better  it will save me a world of trouble and economy  had it been your uncle s doing  i must and  would  have paid him  but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way  i shall offer to pay him to morrow  he will rant and storm about his love for you  and there will be an end of the matter    he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before  on his reading mr  collins s letter  and after laughing at her some time  allowed her at last to go  saying  as she quitted the room   if any young men come for mary or kitty  send them in  for i am quite at leisure    elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight  and  after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room  she was able to join the others with tolerable composure  every thing was too recent for gaiety  but the evening passed tranquilly away  there was no longer anything material to be dreaded  and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time   when her mother went up to her dressing room at night  she followed her  and made the important communication  its effect was most extraordinary  for on first hearing it  mrs  bennet sat quite still  and unable to utter a syllable  nor was it under many  many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard  though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family  or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them  she began at length to recover  to fidget about in her chair  get up  sit down again  wonder  and bless herself    good gracious  lord bless me  only think  dear me  mr  darcy  who would have thought it  and is it really true  oh  my sweetest lizzy  how rich and how great you will be  what pin money  what jewels  what carriages you will have  jane s is nothing to it  nothing at all  i am so pleased  so happy  such a charming man   so handsome  so tall   oh  my dear lizzy  pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before  i hope he will overlook it  dear  dear lizzy  a house in town  every thing that is charming  three daughters married  ten thousand a year  oh  lord  what will become of me  i shall go distracted    this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted  and elizabeth  rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself  soon went away  but before she had been three minutes in her own room  her mother followed her    my dearest child   she cried   i can think of nothing else  ten thousand a year  and very likely more   tis as good as a lord  and a special licence  you must and shall be married by a special licence  but my dearest love  tell me what dish mr  darcy is particularly fond of  that i may have it to morrow    this was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be  and elizabeth found that  though in the certain possession of his warmest affection  and secure of her relations  consent  there was still something to be wished for  but the morrow passed off much better than she expected  for mrs  bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to him  unless it was in her power to offer him any attention  or mark her deference for his opinion   elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him  and mr  bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem    i admire all my three sons in law highly   said he   wickham  perhaps  is my favourite  but i think i shall like  your  husband quite as well as jane s      chapter 60   elizabeth s spirits soon rising to playfulness again  she wanted mr  darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her   how could you begin   said she   i can comprehend your going on charmingly  when you had once made a beginning  but what could set you off in the first place     i cannot fix on the hour  or the spot  or the look  or the words  which laid the foundation  it is too long ago  i was in the middle before i knew that i  had  begun     my beauty you had early withstood  and as for my manners  my behaviour to  you  was at least always bordering on the uncivil  and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not  now be sincere  did you admire me for my impertinence     for the liveliness of your mind  i did     you may as well call it impertinence at once  it was very little less  the fact is  that you were sick of civility  of deference  of officious attention  you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking  and looking  and thinking for  your  approbation alone  i roused  and interested you  because i was so unlike  them   had you not been really amiable  you would have hated me for it  but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself  your feelings were always noble and just  and in your heart  you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you  there  i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it  and really  all things considered  i begin to think it perfectly reasonable  to be sure  you knew no actual good of me  but nobody thinks of  that  when they fall in love     was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield     dearest jane  who could have done less for her  but make a virtue of it by all means  my good qualities are under your protection  and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible  and  in return  it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be  and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last  what made you so shy of me  when you first called  and afterwards dined here  why  especially  when you called  did you look as if you did not care about me     because you were grave and silent  and gave me no encouragement     but i was embarrassed     and so was i     you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner     a man who had felt less  might     how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give  and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it  but i wonder how long you  would  have gone on  if you had been left to yourself  i wonder when you  would  have spoken  if i had not asked you  my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect   too much   i am afraid  for what becomes of the moral  if our comfort springs from a breach of promise  for i ought not to have mentioned the subject  this will never do     you need not distress yourself  the moral will be perfectly fair  lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts  i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude  i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours  my aunt s intelligence had given me hope  and i was determined at once to know every thing     lady catherine has been of infinite use  which ought to make her happy  for she loves to be of use  but tell me  what did you come down to netherfield for  was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed  or had you intended any more serious consequence     my real purpose was to see  you   and to judge  if i could  whether i might ever hope to make you love me  my avowed one  or what i avowed to myself  was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley  and if she were  to make the confession to him which i have since made     shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her     i am more likely to want more time than courage  elizabeth  but it ought to be done  and if you will give me a sheet of paper  it shall be done directly     and if i had not a letter to write myself  i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing  as another young lady once did  but i have an aunt  too  who must not be longer neglected    from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr  darcy had been over rated  elizabeth had never yet answered mrs  gardiner s long letter  but now  having  that  to communicate which she knew would be most welcome  she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness  and immediately wrote as follows    i would have thanked you before  my dear aunt  as i ought to have done  for your long  kind  satisfactory  detail of particulars  but to say the truth  i was too cross to write  you supposed more than really existed  but  now  suppose as much as you choose  give a loose rein to your fancy  indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford  and unless you believe me actually married  you cannot greatly err  you must write again very soon  and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last  i thank you  again and again  for not going to the lakes  how could i be so silly as to wish it  your idea of the ponies is delightful  we will go round the park every day  i am the happiest creature in the world  perhaps other people have said so before  but not one with such justice  i am happier even than jane  she only smiles  i laugh  mr  darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me  you are all to come to pemberley at christmas  yours  etc    mr  darcy s letter to lady catherine was in a different style  and still different from either was what mr  bennet sent to mr  collins  in reply to his last    dear sir    i must trouble you once more for congratulations  elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr  darcy  console lady catherine as well as you can  but  if i were you  i would stand by the nephew  he has more to give    yours sincerely  etc    miss bingley s congratulations to her brother  on his approaching marriage  were all that was affectionate and insincere  she wrote even to jane on the occasion  to express her delight  and repeat all her former professions of regard  jane was not deceived  but she was affected  and though feeling no reliance on her  could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved   the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information  was as sincere as her brother s in sending it  four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight  and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister   before any answer could arrive from mr  collins  or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife  the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge  the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident  lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter  that charlotte  really rejoicing in the match  was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over  at such a moment  the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth  though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought  when she saw mr  darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband  he bore it  however  with admirable calmness  he could even listen to sir william lucas  when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country  and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st  james s  with very decent composure  if he did shrug his shoulders  it was not till sir william was out of sight   mrs  phillips s vulgarity was another  and perhaps a greater  tax on his forbearance  and though mrs  phillips  as well as her sister  stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s good humour encouraged  yet  whenever she  did  speak  she must be vulgar  nor was her respect for him  though it made her more quiet  at all likely to make her more elegant  elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either  and was ever anxious to keep him to herself  and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification  and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure  it added to the hope of the future  and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either  to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley     chapter 61   happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs  bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters  with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs  bingley  and talked of mrs  darcy  may be guessed  i wish i could say  for the sake of her family  that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible  amiable  well informed woman for the rest of her life  though perhaps it was lucky for her husband  who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form  that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly   mr  bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly  his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do  he delighted in going to pemberley  especially when he was least expected   mr  bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth  so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to  his  easy temper  or  her  affectionate heart  the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified  he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire  and jane and elizabeth  in addition to every other source of happiness  were within thirty miles of each other   kitty  to her very material advantage  spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters  in society so superior to what she had generally known  her improvement was great  she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia  and  removed from the influence of lydia s example  she became  by proper attention and management  less irritable  less ignorant  and less insipid  from the further disadvantage of lydia s society she was of course carefully kept  and though mrs  wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her  with the promise of balls and young men  her father would never consent to her going   mary was the only daughter who remained at home  and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs  bennet s being quite unable to sit alone  mary was obliged to mix more with the world  but she could still moralize over every morning visit  and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters  beauty and her own  it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance   as for wickham and lydia  their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters  he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her  and in spite of every thing  was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune  the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage  explained to her that  by his wife at least  if not by himself  such a hope was cherished  the letter was to this effect    my dear lizzy    i wish you joy  if you love mr  darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham  you must be very happy  it is a great comfort to have you so rich  and when you have nothing else to do  i hope you will think of us  i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much  and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help  any place would do  of about three or four hundred a year  but however  do not speak to mr  darcy about it  if you had rather not    yours  etc    as it happened that elizabeth had  much  rather not  she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind  such relief  however  as it was in her power to afford  by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences  she frequently sent them  it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs  under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants  and heedless of the future  must be very insufficient to their support  and whenever they changed their quarters  either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills  their manner of living  even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home  was unsettled in the extreme  they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation  and always spending more than they ought  his affection for her soon sunk into indifference  hers lasted a little longer  and in spite of her youth and her manners  she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her   though darcy could never receive  him  at pemberley  yet  for elizabeth s sake  he assisted him further in his profession  lydia was occasionally a visitor there  when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath  and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long  that even bingley s good humour was overcome  and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone   miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy s marriage  but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley  she dropt all her resentment  was fonder than ever of georgiana  almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore  and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth   pemberley was now georgiana s home  and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see  they were able to love each other even as well as they intended  georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth  though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively  sportive  manner of talking to her brother  he  who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection  she now saw the object of open pleasantry  her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way  by elizabeth s instructions  she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself   lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew  and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement  she sent him language so very abusive  especially of elizabeth  that for some time all intercourse was at an end  but at length  by elizabeth s persuasion  he was prevailed on to overlook the offence  and seek a reconciliation  and  after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt  her resentment gave way  either to her affection for him  or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself  and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley  in spite of that pollution which its woods had received  not merely from the presence of such a mistress  but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city   with the gardiners  they were always on the most intimate terms  darcy  as well as elizabeth  really loved them  and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who  by bringing her into derbyshire  had been the means of uniting them       end of the project gutenberg ebook of pride and prejudice  by jane austen  *** end of this project gutenberg ebook pride and prejudice ***  ***** this file should be named 1342 txt or 1342
