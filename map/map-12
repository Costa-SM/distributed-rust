wickham lydia were all forgotten jane was beyond competition her favourite child at that moment she cared for no other her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense  mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter  bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept  elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief  he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! i had not believed it possible  i suspected as much replied elizabeth but how did he account for it?  it must have been his sisters doing they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other  that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter good girl! it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard  would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!  he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty  this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him  i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed! cried jane oh! lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all! if i could but see _you_ as happy! if there _were_ but such another man for you!  if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time  the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs phillips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton  the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune    chapter 56   one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the diningroom their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered it was lady catherine de bourgh  they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt  she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of introduction had been made  mrs bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth  i hope you are well miss bennet that lady i suppose is your mother  elizabeth replied very concisely that she was  and _that_ i suppose is one of your sisters  yes madam said mrs bennet delighted to speak to lady catherine she is my youngest girl but one my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family  you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence  it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucass  this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west  mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added  may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mrs collins well  yes very well i saw them the night before last  elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled  mrs bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating anything and then rising up said to elizabeth  miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company  go my dear cried her mother and show her ladyship about the different walks i think she will be pleased with the hermitage  elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest downstairs as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the diningparlour and drawingroom and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on  her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waitingwoman was in it they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable  how could i ever think her like her nephew? said she as she looked in her face  as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner  you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come  elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment  indeed you are mistaken madam i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here  miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with but however insincere _you_ may choose to be you shall not find _me_ so my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy though i _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you  if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far what could your ladyship propose by it?  at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted  your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence  if! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?  i never heard that it was  and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it?  i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer  this is not to be borne miss bennet i insist on being satisfied has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage?  your ladyship has declared it to be impossible  it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family you may have drawn him in  if i have i shall be the last person to confess it  miss bennet do you know who i am? i have not been accustomed to such language as this i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns  but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit  let me be rightly understood this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place no never mr darcy is engaged to my daughter now what have you to say?  only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me  lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied  the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind from their infancy they have been intended for each other it was the favourite wish of _his_ mother as well as of hers while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family! do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh? are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?  yes and i had heard it before but what is that to me? if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage its completion depended on others if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice? and if i am that choice why may not i accept him?  because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all you will be censured slighted and despised by everyone connected with him your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us  these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine  obstinate headstrong girl! i am ashamed of you! is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? is nothing due to me on that score? let us sit down you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it i have not been used to submit to any persons whims i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment  _that_ will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on me  i will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the fathers from respectable honourable and ancientthough untitledfamilies their fortune on both sides is splendid they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them? the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune is this to be endured! but it must not shall not be if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up  in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere he is a gentleman i am a gentlemans daughter so far we are equal  true you _are_ a gentlemans daughter but who was your mother? who are your uncles and aunts? do not imagine me ignorant of their condition  whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to _you_  tell me once for all are you engaged to him?  though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moments deliberation  i am not  lady catherine seemed pleased  and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?  i will make no promise of the kind  miss bennet i am shocked and astonished i expected to find a more reasonable young woman but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require  and i certainly _never_ shall give it i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wishedfor promise make their marriage at all more probable? supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was illjudged you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject  not so hasty if you please i have by no means done to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous elopement i know it all that the young mans marrying her was a patchedup business at the expence of your father and uncles and is such a girl to be my nephews sister? is her husband is the son of his late fathers steward to be his brother? heaven and earth!of what are you thinking? are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted?  you can now have nothing further to say she resentfully answered you have insulted me in every possible method i must beg to return to the house  and she rose as she spoke lady catherine rose also and they turned back her ladyship was highly incensed  you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew! unfeeling selfish girl! do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?  lady catherine i have nothing further to say you know my sentiments  you are then resolved to have him?  i have said no such thing i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to _you_ or to any person so wholly unconnected with me  it is well you refuse then to oblige me you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world  neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments concernand the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn  and this is your real opinion! this is your final resolve! very well i shall now know how to act do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point  in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet i send no compliments to your mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously displeased  elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself  she did not choose it said her daughter she would go  she is a very finelooking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy?  elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible    chapter 57   the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy it was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley and _her_ being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to supply the idea she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time  in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning  if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him in that case he would return no more lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way  if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all                            * * * * *  the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs bennets curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject  the next morning as she was going downstairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand  lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room  she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations  she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down he then said  i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony let me congratulate you on a very important conquest  the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued  you look conscious young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the name of your admirer this letter is from mr collins  from mr collins! and what can _he_ have to say?  something very much to the purpose of course he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the goodnatured gossiping lucases i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point what relates to yourself is as follows having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land  can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this? this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desiresplendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentlemans proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of  have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is? but now it comes out  my motive for cautioning you is as follows we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye  _mr darcy_ you see is the man! now lizzy i think i _have_ surprised you could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? mr darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life! it is admirable!  elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her  are you not diverted?  oh! yes pray read on  after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned mr collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydias sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing that is his notion of christian forgiveness! the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes situation and his expectation of a young olivebranch but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it you are not going to be _missish_ i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn?  oh! cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted but it is so strange!  yes_that_ is what makes it amusing had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_ pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr collinss correspondence for any consideration nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my soninlaw and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report? did she call to refuse her consent?  to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr darcys indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much    chapter 58   instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherines visit the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out it was agreed to mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same  they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said  mr darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express  i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted  you must not blame my aunt lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them  if you _will_ thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your _family_ owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of _you_  elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once _my_ affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever  elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable  they walked on without knowing in what direction there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise  it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly  elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of _that_ after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations  what did you say of me that i did not deserve? for though your accusations were illfounded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence  we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility  i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner those were your words you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured methough it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice  i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way  i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me  oh! do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it  darcy mentioned his letter did it said he did it soon make you think better of me? did you on reading it give any credit to its contents?  she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed  i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me  the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies  when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit  the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure  i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of innocence but with me it is not so painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth! what do i not owe you! you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my reception you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased  had you then persuaded yourself that i should?  indeed i had what will you think of my vanity? i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses  my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong how you must have hated me after _that_ evening?  hate you! i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction  i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley you blamed me for coming?  no indeed i felt nothing but surprise  your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive _more_ than my due  my object then replied darcy was to show you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you  he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend  she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther  after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know anything about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home  what could become of mr bingley and jane! was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it  i must ask whether you were surprised? said elizabeth  not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen  that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case  on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together  elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend  did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring?  from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made here and i was convinced of her affection  and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him  it did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sisters sentiments he has heartily forgiven me now  elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at and it was rather too early to begin in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house in the hall they parted    chapter 59   my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to? was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered their room and from all the others when they sat down to table she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor anything else awakened a suspicion of the truth  the evening passed quietly unmarked by anything extraordinary the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather _knew_ that she was happy than _felt_ herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away  at night she opened her heart to jane though suspicion was very far from miss bennets general habits she was absolutely incredulous here  you are joking lizzy this cannot be!engaged to mr darcy! no no you shall not deceive me i know it to be impossible  this is a wretched beginning indeed! my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are engaged  jane looked at her doubtingly oh lizzy! it cannot be i know how much you dislike him  you know nothing of the matter _that_ is all to be forgot perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself  miss bennet still looked all amazement elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth  good heaven! can it be really so! yet now i must believe you cried jane my dear dear lizzy i wouldi do congratulate youbut are you certain? forgive the questionare you quite certain that you can be happy with him?  there can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world but are you pleased jane? shall you like to have such a brother?  very very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you really love him quite well enough? oh lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?  oh yes! you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do when i tell you all  what do you mean?  why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley i am afraid you will be angry  my dearest sister now _be_ serious i want to talk very seriously let me know every thing that i am to know without delay will you tell me how long you have loved him?  it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley  another entreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing further to wish  now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself i always had a value for him were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingleys friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton! i owe all that i know of it to another not to you  elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydias marriage all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation                            * * * * *  good gracious! cried mrs bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley! what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? i had no notion but he would go ashooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company what shall we do with him? lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingleys way  elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet  as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud mrs bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again today?  i advise mr darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has never seen the view  it may do very well for the others replied mr bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty wont it kitty? kitty owned that she had rather stay at home darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented as she went up stairs to get ready mrs bennet followed her saying  i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself but i hope you will not mind it it is all for janes sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then so do not put yourself to inconvenience  during their walk it was resolved that mr bennets consent should be asked in the course of the evening elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation                            * * * * *  in the evening soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme she did not fear her fathers opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her meansthat _she_ his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of herwas a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library she was gone directly  her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious lizzy said he what are you doing? are you out of your senses to be accepting this man? have not you always hated him?  how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate! it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr darcy  or in other words you are determined to have him he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane but will they make you happy?  have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my indifference?  none at all we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him  i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him indeed he has no improper pride he is perfectly amiable you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms  lizzy said her father i have given him my consent he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse anything which he condescended to ask i now give it to _you_ if you are resolved on having him but let me advise you to think better of it i know your disposition lizzy i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage you could scarcely escape discredit and misery my child let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life you know not what you are about  elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her fathers incredulity and reconcile him to the match  well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say if this be the case he deserves you i could not have parted with you my lizzy to anyone less worthy  to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia he heard her with astonishment  this is an evening of wonders indeed! and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellows debts and got him his commission!
