dearest friend  but we will hope  at some future period  to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known  and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence  i depend on you for that   to these highflown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust  and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her  she saw nothing in it really to lament  it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr  bingley s being there  and as to the loss of their society  she was persuaded that jane must cease to regard it  in the enjoyment of his    it is unlucky   said she  after a short pause   that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country  but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware  and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters  mr  bingley will not be detained in london by them     caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter  i will read it to you     when my brother left us yesterday  he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days  but as we are certain it cannot be so  and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again  we have determined on following him thither  that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel  many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter  i wish that i could hear that you  my dearest friend  had any intention of making one of the crowd  but of that i despair  i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings  and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you     it is evident by this   added jane   that he comes back no more this winter     it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean that he  should      why will you think so  it must be his own doing  he is his own master  but you do not know  all   i  will  read you the passage which particularly hurts me  i will have no reserves from  you      mr  darcy is impatient to see his sister  and  to confess the truth   we  are scarcely less eager to meet her again  i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty  elegance  and accomplishments  and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting  from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister  i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject  but i will not leave the country without confiding them  and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable  my brother admires her greatly already  he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing  her relations all wish the connection as much as his own  and a sister s partiality is not misleading me  i think  when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman s heart  with all these circumstances to favour an attachment  and nothing to prevent it  am i wrong  my dearest jane  in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many     what do you think of  this  sentence  my dear lizzy   said jane as she finished it   is it not clear enough  does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister  that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference  and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him  she means  most kindly   to put me on my guard  can there be any other opinion on the subject     yes  there can  for mine is totally different  will you hear it     most willingly     you shall have it in a few words  miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you  and wants him to marry miss darcy  she follows him to town in hope of keeping him there  and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you    jane shook her head    indeed  jane  you ought to believe me  no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection  miss bingley  i am sure  cannot  she is not such a simpleton  could she have seen half as much love in mr  darcy for herself  she would have ordered her wedding clothes  but the case is this  we are not rich enough or grand enough for them  and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother  from the notion that when there has been  one  intermarriage  she may have less trouble in achieving a second  in which there is certainly some ingenuity  and i dare say it would succeed  if miss de bourgh were out of the way  but  my dearest jane  you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy  he is in the smallest degree less sensible of  your  merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday  or that it will be in her power to persuade him that  instead of being in love with you  he is very much in love with her friend     if we thought alike of miss bingley   replied jane   your representation of all this might make me quite easy  but i know the foundation is unjust  caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone  and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself     that is right  you could not have started a more happy idea  since you will not take comfort in mine  believe her to be deceived  by all means  you have now done your duty by her  and must fret no longer     but  my dear sister  can i be happy  even supposing the best  in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere     you must decide for yourself   said elizabeth   and if  upon mature deliberation  you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife  i advise you by all means to refuse him     how can you talk so   said jane  faintly smiling   you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation  i could not hesitate     i did not think you would  and that being the case  i cannot consider your situation with much compassion     but if he returns no more this winter  my choice will never be required  a thousand things may arise in six months    the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt  it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline s interested wishes  and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes  however openly or artfully spoken  could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone   she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject  and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect  jane s temper was not desponding  and she was gradually led to hope  though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope  that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart   they agreed that mrs  bennet should only hear of the departure of the family  without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct  but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern  and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together  after lamenting it  however  at some length  she had the consolation that mr  bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn  and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration  that though he had been invited only to a family dinner  she would take care to have two full courses     chapter 22   the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr  collins  elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her   it keeps him in good humour   said she   and i am more obliged to you than i can express   charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful  and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time  this was very amiable  but charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of  its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of mr  collins s addresses  by engaging them towards herself  such was miss lucas s scheme  and appearances were so favourable  that when they parted at night  she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon  but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character  for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness  and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet  he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins  from a conviction that if they saw him depart  they could not fail to conjecture his design  and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise  for though feeling almost secure  and with reason  for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging  he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday  his reception  however  was of the most flattering kind  miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house  and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane  but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there   in as short a time as mr  collins s long speeches would allow  everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both  and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men  and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present  the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness  the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance  and miss lucas  who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment  cared not how soon that establishment were gained   sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent  and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity  mr  collins s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter  to whom they could give little fortune  and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair  lady lucas began directly to calculate  with more interest than the matter had ever excited before  how many years longer mr  bennet was likely to live  and sir william gave it as his decided opinion  that whenever mr  collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate  it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st  james s  the whole family  in short  were properly overjoyed on the occasion  the younger girls formed hopes of  coming out  a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done  and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte s dying an old maid  charlotte herself was tolerably composed  she had gained her point  and had time to consider of it  her reflections were in general satisfactory  mr  collins  to be sure  was neither sensible nor agreeable  his society was irksome  and his attachment to her must be imaginary  but still he would be her husband  without thinking highly either of men or matrimony  marriage had always been her object  it was the only provision for well educated young women of small fortune  and however uncertain of giving happiness  must be their pleasantest preservative from want  this preservative she had now obtained  and at the age of twenty seven  without having ever been handsome  she felt all the good luck of it  the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet  whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person  elizabeth would wonder  and probably would blame her  and though her resolution was not to be shaken  her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation  she resolved to give her the information herself  and therefore charged mr  collins  when he returned to longbourn to dinner  to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family  a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given  but it could not be kept without difficulty  for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade  and he was at the same time exercising great self denial  for he was longing to publish his prosperous love   as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family  the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night  and mrs  bennet  with great politeness and cordiality  said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again  whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them    my dear madam   he replied   this invitation is particularly gratifying  because it is what i have been hoping to receive  and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible    they were all astonished  and mr  bennet  who could by no means wish for so speedy a return  immediately said    but is there not danger of lady catherine s disapprobation here  my good sir  you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness     my dear sir   replied mr  collins   i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution  and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship s concurrence     you cannot be too much upon your guard  risk anything rather than her displeasure  and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again  which i should think exceedingly probable  stay quietly at home  and be satisfied that  we  shall take no offence     believe me  my dear sir  my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention  and depend upon it  you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this  and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire  as for my fair cousins  though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary  i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness  not excepting my cousin elizabeth    with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew  all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return  mrs  bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls  and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him  she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others  there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her  and though by no means so clever as herself  she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers  he might become a very agreeable companion  but on the following morning  every hope of this kind was done away  miss lucas called soon after breakfast  and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before   the possibility of mr  collins s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two  but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself  and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum  and she could not help crying out    engaged to mr  collins  my dear charlotte  impossible    the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story  gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach  though  as it was no more than she expected  she soon regained her composure  and calmly replied    why should you be surprised  my dear eliza  do you think it incredible that mr  collins should be able to procure any woman s good opinion  because he was not so happy as to succeed with you    but elizabeth had now recollected herself  and making a strong effort for it  was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her  and that she wished her all imaginable happiness    i see what you are feeling   replied charlotte   you must be surprised  very much surprised  so lately as mr  collins was wishing to marry you  but when you have had time to think it over  i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done  i am not romantic  you know  i never was  i ask only a comfortable home  and considering mr  collins s character  connection  and situation in life  i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state    elizabeth quietly answered  undoubtedly   and after an awkward pause  they returned to the rest of the family  charlotte did not stay much longer  and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard  it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match  the strangeness of mr  collins s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted  she had always felt that charlotte s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own  but she had not supposed it to be possible that  when called into action  she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage  charlotte the wife of mr  collins was a most humiliating picture  and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem  was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen     chapter 23   elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters  reflecting on what she had heard  and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it  when sir william lucas himself appeared  sent by his daughter  to announce her engagement to the family  with many compliments to them  and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses  he unfolded the matter  to an audience not merely wondering  but incredulous  for mrs  bennet  with more perseverance than politeness  protested he must be entirely mistaken  and lydia  always unguarded and often uncivil  boisterously exclaimed    good lord  sir william  how can you tell such a story  do not you know that mr  collins wants to marry lizzy    nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment  but sir william s good breeding carried him through it all  and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information  he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy   elizabeth  feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation  now put herself forward to confirm his account  by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself  and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william  in which she was readily joined by jane  and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match  the excellent character of mr  collins  and the convenient distance of hunsford from london   mrs  bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained  but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent  in the first place  she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter  secondly  she was very sure that mr  collins had been taken in  thirdly  she trusted that they would never be happy together  and fourthly  that the match might be broken off  two inferences  however  were plainly deduced from the whole  one  that elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief  and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all  and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day  nothing could console and nothing could appease her  nor did that day wear out her resentment  a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her  a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude  and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter   mr  bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion  and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort  for it gratified him  he said  to discover that charlotte lucas  whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible  was as foolish as his wife  and more foolish than his daughter   jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match  but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness  nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable  kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas  for mr  collins was only a clergyman  and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton   lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs  bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married  and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was  though mrs  bennet s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away   between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject  and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again  her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister  of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken  and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious  as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return   jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter  and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again  the promised letter of thanks from mr  collins arrived on tuesday  addressed to their father  and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth s abode in the family might have prompted  after discharging his conscience on that head  he proceeded to inform them  with many rapturous expressions  of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour  miss lucas  and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn  whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight  for lady catherine  he added  so heartily approved his marriage  that she wished it to take place as soon as possible  which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men   mr  collins s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs  bennet  on the contrary  she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband  it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge  it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome  she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent  and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable  such were the gentle murmurs of mrs  bennet  and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr  bingley s continued absence   neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject  day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter  a report which highly incensed mrs  bennet  and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood   even elizabeth began to fear  not that bingley was indifferent  but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away  unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane s happiness  and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover  she could not prevent its frequently occurring  the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend  assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much  she feared  for the strength of his attachment   as for jane   her  anxiety under this suspense was  of course  more painful than elizabeth s  but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing  and between herself and elizabeth  therefore  the subject was never alluded to  but as no such delicacy restrained her mother  an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley  express her impatience for his arrival  or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used  it needed all jane s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity   mr  collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight  but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction  he was too happy  however  to need much attention  and luckily for the others  the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company  the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge  and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed   mrs  bennet was really in a most pitiable state  the very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour  and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of  the sight of miss lucas was odious to her  as her successor in that house  she regarded her with jealous abhorrence  whenever charlotte came to see them  she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession  and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr  collins  was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate  and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house  as soon as mr  bennet were dead  she complained bitterly of all this to her husband    indeed  mr  bennet   said she   it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house  that i should be forced to make way for  her   and live to see her take her place in it     my dear  do not give way to such gloomy thoughts  let us hope for better things  let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor    this was not very consoling to mrs  bennet  and therefore  instead of making any answer  she went on as before    i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate  if it was not for the entail  i should not mind it     what should not you mind     i should not mind anything at all     let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility     i never can be thankful  mr  bennet  for anything about the entail  how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one s own daughters  i cannot understand  and all for the sake of mr  collins too  why should  he  have it more than anybody else     i leave it to yourself to determine   said mr  bennet     chapter 24   miss bingley s letter arrived  and put an end to doubt  the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter  and concluded with her brother s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country   hope was over  entirely over  and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter  she found little  except the professed affection of the writer  that could give her any comfort  miss darcy s praise occupied the chief of it  her many attractions were again dwelt on  and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy  and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter  she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother s being an inmate of mr  darcy s house  and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture   elizabeth  to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this  heard it in silent indignation  her heart was divided between concern for her sister  and resentment against all others  to caroline s assertion of her brother s being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit  that he was really fond of jane  she doubted no more than she had ever done  and much as she had always been disposed to like him  she could not think without anger  hardly without contempt  on that easiness of temper  that want of proper resolution  which now made him the slave of his designing friends  and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination  had his own happiness  however  been the only sacrifice  he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best  but her sister s was involved in it  as she thought he must be sensible himself  it was a subject  in short  on which reflection would be long indulged  and must be unavailing  she could think of nothing else  and yet whether bingley s regard had really died away  or were suppressed by his friends  interference  whether he had been aware of jane s attachment  or whether it had escaped his observation  whatever were the case  though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference  her sister s situation remained the same  her peace equally wounded   a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth  but at last  on mrs  bennet s leaving them together  after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master  she could not help saying    oh  that my dear mother had more command over herself  she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him  but i will not repine  it cannot last long  he will be forgot  and we shall all be as we were before    elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude  but said nothing    you doubt me   cried jane  slightly colouring   indeed  you have no reason  he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance  but that is all  i have nothing either to hope or fear  and nothing to reproach him with  thank god  i have not  that  pain  a little time  therefore  i shall certainly try to get the better    with a stronger voice she soon added   i have this comfort immediately  that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side  and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself     my dear jane   exclaimed elizabeth   you are too good  your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic  i do not know what to say to you  i feel as if i had never done you justice  or loved you as you deserve    miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit  and threw back the praise on her sister s warm affection    nay   said elizabeth   this is not fair   you  wish to think all the world respectable  and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody  i only want to think  you  perfect  and you set yourself against it  do not be afraid of my running into any excess  of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will  you need not  there are few people whom i really love  and still fewer of whom i think well  the more i see of the world  the more am i dissatisfied with it  and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters  and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense  i have met with two instances lately  one i will not mention  the other is charlotte s marriage  it is unaccountable  in every view it is unaccountable     my dear lizzy  do not give way to such feelings as these  they will ruin your happiness  you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper  consider mr  collins s respectability  and charlotte s steady  prudent character  remember that she is one of a large family  that as to fortune  it is a most eligible match  and be ready to believe  for everybody s sake  that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin     to oblige you  i would try to believe almost anything  but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this  for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him  i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart  my dear jane  mr  collins is a conceited  pompous  narrow minded  silly man  you know he is  as well as i do  and you must feel  as well as i do  that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking  you shall not defend her  though it is charlotte lucas  you shall not  for the sake of one individual  change the meaning of principle and integrity  nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me  that selfishness is prudence  and insensibility of danger security for happiness     i must think your language too strong in speaking of both   replied jane   and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together  but enough of this  you alluded to something else  you mentioned  two  instances  i cannot misunderstand you  but i entreat you  dear lizzy  not to pain me by thinking  that person  to blame  and saying your opinion of him is sunk  we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured  we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect  it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us  women fancy admiration means more than it does     and men take care that they should     if it is designedly done  they cannot be justified  but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine     i am far from attributing any part of mr  bingley s conduct to design   said elizabeth   but without scheming to do wrong  or to make others unhappy  there may be error  and there may be misery  thoughtlessness  want of attention to other people s feelings  and want of resolution  will do the business     and do you impute it to either of those     yes  to the last  but if i go on  i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem  stop me whilst you can     you persist  then  in supposing his sisters influence him     yes  in conjunction with his friend     i cannot believe it  why should they try to influence him  they can only wish his happiness  and if he is attached to me  no other woman can secure it     your first position is false  they may wish many things besides his happiness  they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence  they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money  great connections  and pride     beyond a doubt  they  do  wish him to choose miss darcy   replied jane   but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing  they have known her much longer than they have known me  no wonder if they love her better  but  whatever may be their own wishes  it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother s  what sister would think herself at liberty to do it  unless there were something very objectionable  if they believed him attached to me  they would not try to part us  if he were so  they could not succeed  by supposing such an affection  you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong  and me most unhappy  do not distress me by the idea  i am not ashamed of having been mistaken  or  at least  it is light  it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters  let me take it in the best light  in the light in which it may be understood    elizabeth could not oppose such a wish  and from this time mr  bingley s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them   mrs  bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more  and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly  there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity  her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself  that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking  which ceased when he saw her no more  but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time  she had the same story to repeat every day  mrs  bennet s best comfort was that mr  bingley must be down again in the summer   mr  bennet treated the matter differently   so  lizzy   said he one day   your sister is crossed in love  i find  i congratulate her  next to being married  a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then  it is something to think of  and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions  when is your turn to come  you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane  now is your time  here are officers enough in meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country  let wickham be  your  man  he is a pleasant fellow  and would jilt you creditably     thank you  sir  but a less agreeable man would satisfy me  we must not all expect jane s good fortune     true   said mr  bennet   but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you  you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it    mr  wickham s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family  they saw him often  and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve  the whole of what elizabeth had already heard  his claims on mr  darcy  and all that he had suffered from him  was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed  and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked mr  darcy before they had known anything of the matter   miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case  unknown to the society of hertfordshire  her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances  and urged the possibility of mistakes  but by everybody else mr  darcy was condemned as the worst of men     chapter 25   after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity  mr  collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday  the pain of separation  however  might be alleviated on his side  by preparations for the reception of his bride  as he had reason to hope  that shortly after his return into hertfordshire  the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men  he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before  wished his fair cousins health and happiness again  and promised their father another letter of thanks   on the following monday  mrs  bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife  who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn  mr  gardiner was a sensible  gentlemanlike man  greatly superior to his sister  as well by nature as education  the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade  and within view of his own warehouses  could have been so well bred and agreeable  mrs  gardiner  who was several years younger than mrs  bennet and mrs  phillips  was an amiable  intelligent  elegant woman  and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces  between the two eldest and herself especially  there subsisted a particular regard  they had frequently been staying with her in town   the first part of mrs  gardiner s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions  when this was done she had a less active part to play  it became her turn to listen  mrs  bennet had many grievances to relate  and much to complain of  they had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister  two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage  and after all there was nothing in it    i do not blame jane   she continued   for jane would have got mr  bingley if she could  but lizzy  oh  sister  it is very hard to think that she might have been mr  collins s wife by this time  had it not been for her own perverseness  he made her an offer in this very room  and she refused him  the consequence of it is  that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have  and that the longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever  the lucases are very artful people indeed  sister  they are all for what they can get  i am sorry to say it of them  but so it is  it makes me very nervous and poorly  to be thwarted so in my own family  and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else  however  your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts  and i am very glad to hear what you tell us  of long sleeves    mrs  gardiner  to whom the chief of this news had been given before  in the course of jane and elizabeth s correspondence with her  made her sister a slight answer  and  in compassion to her nieces  turned the conversation   when alone with elizabeth afterwards  she spoke more on the subject   it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane   said she   i am sorry it went off  but these things happen so often  a young man  such as you describe mr  bingley  so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks  and when accident separates them  so easily forgets her  that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent     an excellent consolation in its way   said elizabeth   but it will not do for  us   we do not suffer by  accident   it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before     but that expression of  violently in love  is so hackneyed  so doubtful  so indefinite  that it gives me very little idea  it is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half hour s acquaintance  as to a real  strong attachment  pray  how  violent was  mr  bingley s love     i never saw a more promising inclination  he was growing quite inattentive to other people  and wholly engrossed by her  every time they met  it was more decided and remarkable  at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies  by not asking them to dance  and i spoke to him twice myself  without receiving an answer  could there be finer symptoms  is not general incivility the very essence of love     oh  yes   of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt  poor jane  i am sorry for her  because  with her disposition  she may not get over it immediately  it had better have happened to  you   lizzy  you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner  but do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us  change of scene might be of service  and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything    elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal  and felt persuaded of her sister s ready acquiescence    i hope   added mrs  gardiner   that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her  we live in so different a part of town  all our connections are so different  and  as you well know  we go out so little  that it is very improbable that they should meet at all  unless he really comes to see her     and  that  is quite impossible  for he is now in the custody of his friend  and mr  darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london  my dear aunt  how could you think of it  mr  darcy may perhaps have  heard  of such a place as gracechurch street  but he would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities  were he once to enter it  and depend upon it  mr  bingley never stirs without him     so much the better  i hope they will not meet at all  but does not jane correspond with his sister   she  will not be able to help calling     she will drop the acquaintance entirely    but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point  as well as the still more interesting one of bingley s being withheld from seeing jane  she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her  on examination  that she did not consider it entirely hopeless  it was possible  and sometimes she thought it probable  that his affection might be reanimated  and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s attractions   miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure  and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time  than as she hoped by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother  she might occasionally spend a morning with her  without any danger of seeing him   the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn  and what with the phillipses  the lucases  and the officers  there was not a day without its engagement  mrs  bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister  that they did not once sit down to a family dinner  when the engagement was for home  some of the officers always made part of it  of which officers mr  wickham was sure to be one  and on these occasions  mrs  gardiner  rendered suspicious by elizabeth s warm commendation  narrowly observed them both  without supposing them  from what she saw  to be very seriously in love  their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy  and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire  and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment   to mrs  gardiner  wickham had one means of affording pleasure  unconnected with his general powers  about ten or a dozen years ago  before her marriage  she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged  they had  therefore  many acquaintances in common  and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy s father  it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring   mrs  gardiner had seen pemberley  and known the late mr  darcy by character perfectly well  here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse  in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give  and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor  she was delighting both him and herself  on being made acquainted with the present mr  darcy s treatment of him  she tried to remember some of that gentleman s reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it  and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr  fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud  ill natured boy     chapter 26   mrs  gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone  after honestly telling her what she thought  she thus went on    you are too sensible a girl  lizzy  to fall in love merely because you are warned against it  and  therefore  i am not afraid of speaking openly  seriously  i would have you be on your guard  do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent  i have nothing to say against  him   he is a most interesting young man  and if he had the fortune he ought to have  i should think you could not do better  but as it is  you must not let your fancy run away with you  you have sense  and we all expect you to use it  your father would depend on  your  resolution and good conduct  i am sure  you must not disappoint your father     my dear aunt  this is being serious indeed     yes  and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise     well  then  you need not be under any alarm  i will take care of myself  and of mr  wickham too  he shall not be in love with me  if i can prevent it     elizabeth  you are not serious now     i beg your pardon  i will try again  at present i am not in love with mr  wickham  no  i certainly am not  but he is  beyond all comparison  the most agreeable man i ever saw  and if he becomes really attached to me  i believe it will be better that he should not  i see the imprudence of it  oh   that  abominable mr  darcy  my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour  and i should be miserable to forfeit it  my father  however  is partial to mr  wickham  in short  my dear aunt  i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy  but since we see every day that where there is affection  young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other  how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted  or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist  all that i can promise you  therefore  is not to be in a hurry  i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object  when i am in company with him  i will not be wishing  in short  i will do my best     perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often  at least  you should not  remind  your mother of inviting him     as i did the other day   said elizabeth with a conscious smile   very true  it will be wise in me to refrain from  that   but do not imagine that he is always here so often  it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week  you know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends  but really  and upon my honour  i will try to do what i think to be the wisest  and now i hope you are satisfied    her aunt assured her that she was  and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints  they parted  a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point  without being resented   mr  collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane  but as he took up his abode with the lucases  his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs  bennet  his marriage was now fast approaching  and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable  and even repeatedly to say  in an ill natured tone  that she   wished  they might be happy   thursday was to be the wedding day  and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit  and when she rose to take leave  elizabeth  ashamed of her mother s ungracious and reluctant good wishes  and sincerely affected herself  accompanied her out of the room  as they went downstairs together  charlotte said    i shall depend on hearing from you very often  eliza      that  you certainly shall     and i have another favour to ask you  will you come and see me     we shall often meet  i hope  in hertfordshire     i am not likely to leave kent for some time  promise me  therefore  to come to hunsford    elizabeth could not refuse  though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit    my father and maria are coming to me in march   added charlotte   and i hope you will consent to be of the party  indeed  eliza  you will be as welcome as either of them    the wedding took place  the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door  and everybody had as much to say  or to hear  on the subject as usual  elizabeth soon heard from her friend  and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been  that it should be equally unreserved was impossible  elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over  and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent  it was for the sake of what had been  rather than what was  charlotte s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness  there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home  how she would like lady catherine  and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be  though  when the letters were read  elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen  she wrote cheerfully  seemed surrounded with comforts  and mentioned nothing which she could not praise  the house  furniture  neighbourhood  and roads  were all to her taste  and lady catherine s behaviour was most friendly and obliging  it was mr  collins s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened  and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest   jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london  and when she wrote again  elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys   her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is  jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline  she accounted for it  however  by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost    my aunt   she continued   is going to morrow into that part of the town  and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street    she wrote again when the visit was paid  and she had seen miss bingley   i did not think caroline in spirits   were her words   but she was very glad to see me  and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london  i was right  therefore  my last letter had never reached her  i inquired after their brother  of course  he was well  but so much engaged with mr  darcy that they scarcely ever saw him  i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner  i wish i could see her  my visit was not long  as caroline and mrs  hurst were going out  i dare say i shall see them soon here    elizabeth shook her head over this letter  it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr  bingley her sister s being in town   four weeks passed away  and jane saw nothing of him  she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it  but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley s inattention  after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight  and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her  the visitor did at last appear  but the shortness of her stay  and yet more  the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer  the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt    my dearest lizzy will  i am sure  be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement  at my expense  when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley s regard for me  but  my dear sister  though the event has proved you right  do not think me obstinate if i still assert that  considering what her behaviour was  my confidence was as natural as your suspicion  i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me  but if the same circumstances were to happen again  i am sure i should be deceived again  caroline did not return my visit till yesterday  and not a note  not a line  did i receive in the meantime  when she did come  it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it  she made a slight  formal apology  for not calling before  said not a word of wishing to see me again  and was in every respect so altered a creature  that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer  i pity  though i cannot help blaming her  she was very wrong in singling me out as she did  i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side  but i pity her  because she must feel that she has been acting wrong  and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it  i need not explain myself farther  and though  we  know this anxiety to be quite needless  yet if she feels it  it will easily account for her behaviour to me  and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister  whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable  i cannot but wonder  however  at her having any such fears now  because  if he had at all cared about me  we must have met  long ago  he knows of my being in town  i am certain  from something she said herself  and yet it would seem  by her manner of talking  as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy  i cannot understand it  if i were not afraid of judging harshly  i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this  but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought  and think only of what will make me happy  your affection  and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt  let me hear from you very soon  miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again  of giving up the house  but not with any certainty  we had better not mention it  i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford  pray go to see them  with sir william and maria  i am sure you will be very comfortable there   yours  etc    this letter gave elizabeth some pain  but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped  by the sister at least  all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over  she would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions  his character sunk on every review of it  and as a punishment for him  as well as a possible advantage to jane  she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr  darcy s sister  as by wickham s account  she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away   mrs  gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman  and required information  and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself  his apparent partiality had subsided  his attentions were over  he was the admirer of some one else  elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all  but she could see it and write of it without material pain  her heart had been but slightly touched  and her vanity was satisfied with believing that  she  would have been his only choice  had fortune permitted it  the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable  but elizabeth  less clear sighted perhaps in this case than in charlotte s  did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence  nothing  on the contrary  could be more natural  and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her  she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both  and could very sincerely wish him happy   all this was acknowledged to mrs  gardiner  and after relating the circumstances  she thus went on   i am now convinced  my dear aunt  that i have never been much in love  for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion  i should at present detest his very name  and wish him all manner of evil  but my feelings are not only cordial towards  him   they are even impartial towards miss king  i cannot find out that i hate her at all  or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl  there can be no love in all this  my watchfulness has been effectual  and though i certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were i distractedly in love with him  i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance  importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly  kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do  they are young in the ways of the world  and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain      chapter 27   with no greater events than these in the longbourn family  and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton  sometimes dirty and sometimes cold  did january and february pass away  march was to take elizabeth to hunsford  she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither  but charlotte  she soon found  was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty  absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again  and weakened her disgust of mr  collins  there was novelty in the scheme  and as  with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters  home could not be faultless  a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake  the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane  and  in short  as the time drew near  she would have been very sorry for any delay  everything  however  went on smoothly  and was finally settled according to charlotte s first sketch  she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter  the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time  and the plan became perfect as plan could be   the only pain was in leaving her father  who would certainly miss her  and who  when it came to the point  so little liked her going  that he told her to write to him  and almost promised to answer her letter   the farewell between herself and mr  wickham was perfectly friendly  on his side even more  his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention  the first to listen and to pity  the first to be admired  and in his manner of bidding her adieu  wishing her every enjoyment  reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh  and trusting their opinion of her  their opinion of everybody  would always coincide  there was a solicitude  an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard  and she parted from him convinced that  whether married or single  he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing   her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable  sir william lucas  and his daughter maria  a good humoured girl  but as empty headed as himself  had nothing to say that could be worth hearing  and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise  elizabeth loved absurdities  but she had known sir william s too long  he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood  and his civilities were worn out  like his information   it was a journey of only twenty four miles  and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon  as they drove to mr  gardiner s door  jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival  when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them  and elizabeth  looking earnestly in her face  was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever  on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls  whose eagerness for their cousin s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room  and whose shyness  as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth  prevented their coming lower  all was joy and kindness  the day passed most pleasantly away  the morning in bustle and shopping  and the evening at one of the theatres   elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt  their first object was her sister  and she was more grieved than astonished to hear  in reply to her minute inquiries  that though jane always struggled to support her spirits  there were periods of dejection  it was reasonable  however  to hope that they would not continue long  mrs  gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley s visit in gracechurch street  and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself  which proved that the former had  from her heart  given up the acquaintance   mrs  gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham s desertion  and complimented her on bearing it so well    but my dear elizabeth   she added   what sort of girl is miss king  i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary     pray  my dear aunt  what is the difference in matrimonial affairs  between the mercenary and the prudent motive  where does discretion end  and avarice begin  last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me  because it would be imprudent  and now  because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds  you want to find out that he is mercenary     if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is  i shall know what to think     she is a very good kind of girl  i believe  i know no harm of her     but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather s death made her mistress of this fortune     no  why should he  if it were not allowable for him to gain  my  affections because i had no money  what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about  and who was equally poor     but there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event     a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe  if  she  does not object to it  why should  we       her  not objecting does not justify  him   it only shows her being deficient in something herself  sense or feeling     well   cried elizabeth   have it as you choose   he  shall be mercenary  and  she  shall be foolish     no  lizzy  that is what i do  not  choose  i should be sorry  you know  to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire     oh  if that is all  i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire  and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better  i am sick of them all  thank heaven  i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality  who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him  stupid men are the only ones worth knowing  after all     take care  lizzy  that speech savours strongly of disappointment    before they were separated by the conclusion of the play  she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer    we have not determined how far it shall carry us   said mrs  gardiner   but  perhaps  to the lakes    no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth  and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful   oh  my dear  dear aunt   she rapturously cried   what delight  what felicity  you give me fresh life and vigour  adieu to disappointment and spleen  what are young men to rocks and mountains  oh  what hours of transport we shall spend  and when we  do  return  it shall not be like other travellers  without being able to give one accurate idea of anything  we  will  know where we have gone  we  will  recollect what we have seen  lakes  mountains  and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations  nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene  will we begin quarreling about its relative situation  let  our  first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers      chapter 28   every object in the next day s journey was new and interesting to elizabeth  and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment  for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health  and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight   when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford  every eye was in search of the parsonage  and every turning expected to bring it in view  the palings of rosings park was their boundary on one side  elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants   at length the parsonage was discernible  the garden sloping to the road  the house standing in it  the green pales  and the laurel hedge  everything declared they were arriving  mr  collins and charlotte appeared at the door  and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house  amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party  in a moment they were all out of the chaise  rejoicing at the sight of each other  mrs  collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure  and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received  she saw instantly that her cousin s manners were not altered by his marriage  his formal civility was just what it had been  and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family  they were then  with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance  taken into the house  and as soon as they were in the parlour  he welcomed them a second time  with ostentatious formality to his humble abode  and punctually repeated all his wife s offers of refreshment   elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory  and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room  its aspect and its furniture  he addressed himself particularly to her  as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him  but though everything seemed neat and comfortable  she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance  and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion  when mr  collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed  which certainly was not unseldom  she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte  once or twice she could discern a faint blush  but in general charlotte wisely did not hear  after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room  from the sideboard to the fender  to give an account of their journey  and of all that had happened in london  mr  collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden  which was large and well laid out  and to the cultivation of which he attended himself  to work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures  and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise  and owned she encouraged it as much as possible  here  leading the way through every walk and cross walk  and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for  every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind  he could number the fields in every direction  and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump  but of all the views which his garden  or which the country or kingdom could boast  none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings  afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house  it was a handsome modern building  well situated on rising ground   from his garden  mr  collins would have led them round his two meadows  but the ladies  not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost  turned back  and while sir william accompanied him  charlotte took her sister and friend over the house  extremely well pleased  probably  to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband s help  it was rather small  but well built and convenient  and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit  when mr  collins could be forgotten  there was really an air of great comfort throughout  and by charlotte s evident enjoyment of it  elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten   she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country  it was spoken of again while they were at dinner  when mr  collins joining in  observed    yes  miss elizabeth  you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church  and i need not say you will be delighted with her  she is all affability and condescension  and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over  i have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here  her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming  we dine at rosings twice every week  and are never allowed to walk home  her ladyship s carriage is regularly ordered for us  i  should  say  one of her ladyship s carriages  for she has several     lady catherine is a very respectable  sensible woman indeed   added charlotte   and a most attentive neighbour     very true  my dear  that is exactly what i say  she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference    the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news  and telling again what had already been written  and when it closed  elizabeth  in the solitude of her chamber  had to meditate upon charlotte s degree of contentment  to understand her address in guiding  and composure in bearing with  her husband  and to acknowledge that it was all done very well  she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass  the quiet tenor of their usual employments  the vexatious interruptions of mr  collins  and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings  a lively imagination soon settled it all   about the middle of the next day  as she was in her room getting ready for a walk  a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion  and  after listening a moment  she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry  and calling loudly after her  she opened the door and met maria in the landing place  who  breathless with agitation  cried out     oh  my dear eliza  pray make haste and come into the dining room  for there is such a sight to be seen  i will not tell you what it is  make haste  and come down this moment    elizabeth asked questions in vain  maria would tell her nothing more  and down they ran into the dining room  which fronted the lane  in quest of this wonder  it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate    and is this all   cried elizabeth   i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden  and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter     la  my dear   said maria  quite shocked at the mistake   it is not lady catherine  the old lady is mrs  jenkinson  who lives with them  the other is miss de bourgh  only look at her  she is quite a little creature  who would have thought that she could be so thin and small     she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind  why does she not come in     oh  charlotte says she hardly ever does  it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in     i like her appearance   said elizabeth  struck with other ideas   she looks sickly and cross  yes  she will do for him very well  she will make him a very proper wife    mr  collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies  and sir william  to elizabeth s high diversion  was stationed in the doorway  in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him  and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way   at length there was nothing more to be said  the ladies drove on  and the others returned into the house  mr  collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune  which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day     chapter 29   mr  collins s triumph  in consequence of this invitation  was complete  the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors  and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife  was exactly what he had wished for  and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon  was such an instance of lady catherine s condescension  as he knew not how to admire enough    i confess   said he   that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings  i rather expected  from my knowledge of her affability  that it would happen  but who could have foreseen such an attention as this  who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there  an invitation  moreover  including the whole party  so immediately after your arrival     i am the less surprised at what has happened   replied sir william   from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are  which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire  about the court  such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon    scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings  mr  collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect  that the sight of such rooms  so many servants  and so splendid a dinner  might not wholly overpower them   when the ladies were separating for the toilette  he said to elizabeth     do not make yourself uneasy  my dear cousin  about your apparel  lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter  i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest  there is no occasion for anything more  lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed  she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved    while they were dressing  he came two or three times to their different doors  to recommend their being quick  as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner  such formidable accounts of her ladyship  and her manner of living  quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company  and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st  james s   as the weather was fine  they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park  every park has its beauty and its prospects  and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with  though she could not be in such raptures as mr  collins expected the scene to inspire  and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house  and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh   when they ascended the steps to the hall  maria s alarm was every moment increasing  and even sir william did not look perfectly calm  elizabeth s courage did not fail her  she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue  and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation   from the entrance hall  of which mr  collins pointed out  with a rapturous air  the fine proportion and the finished ornaments  they followed the servants through an ante chamber  to the room where lady catherine  her daughter  and mrs  jenkinson were sitting  her ladyship  with great condescension  arose to receive them  and as mrs  collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers  it was performed in a proper manner  without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary   in spite of having been at st  james s  sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him  that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow  and take his seat without saying a word  and his daughter  frightened almost out of her senses  sat on the edge of her chair  not knowing which way to look  elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene  and could observe the three ladies before her composedly  lady catherine was a tall  large woman  with strongly marked features  which might once have been handsome  her air was not conciliating  nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank  she was not rendered formidable by silence  but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone  as marked her self importance  and brought mr  wickham immediately to elizabeth s mind  and from the observation of the day altogether  she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he represented   when  after examining the mother  in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr  darcy  she turned her eyes on the daughter  she could almost have joined in maria s astonishment at her being so thin and so small  there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies  miss de bourgh was pale and sickly  her features  though not plain  were insignificant  and she spoke very little  except in a low voice  to mrs  jenkinson  in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable  and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said  and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes   after sitting a few minutes  they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view  mr  collins attending them to point out its beauties  and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer   the dinner was exceedingly handsome  and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr  collins had promised  and  as he had likewise foretold  he took his seat at the bottom of the table  by her ladyship s desire  and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater  he carved  and ate  and praised with delighted alacrity  and every dish was commended  first by him and then by sir william  who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said  in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear  but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration  and gave most gracious smiles  especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them  the party did not supply much conversation  elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening  but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh  the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine  and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time  mrs  jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate  pressing her to try some other dish  and fearing she was indisposed  maria thought speaking out of the question  and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire   when the ladies returned to the drawing room  there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk  which she did without any intermission till coffee came in  delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner  as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted  she inquired into charlotte s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely  gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all  told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers  and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry  elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady s attention  which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others  in the intervals of her discourse with mrs  collins  she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth  but especially to the latter  of whose connections she knew the least  and who she observed to mrs  collins was a very genteel  pretty kind of girl  she asked her  at different times  how many sisters she had  whether they were older or younger than herself  whether any of them were likely to be married  whether they were handsome  where they had been educated  what carriage her father kept  and what had been her mother s maiden name  elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly  lady catherine then observed    your father s estate is entailed on mr  collins  i think  for your sake   turning to charlotte   i am glad of it  but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line  it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh s family  do you play and sing  miss bennet     a little     oh  then  some time or other we shall be happy to hear you  our instrument is a capital one  probably superior to    you shall try it some day  do your sisters play and sing     one of them does     why did not you all learn  you ought all to have learned  the miss webbs all play  and their father has not so good an income as yours  do you draw     no  not at all     what  none of you     not one     that is very strange  but i suppose you had no opportunity  your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters     my mother would have had no objection  but my father hates london     has your governess left you     we never had any governess     no governess  how was that possible  five daughters brought up at home without a governess  i never heard of such a thing  your mother must have been quite a slave to your education    elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case    then  who taught you  who attended to you  without a governess  you must have been neglected     compared with some families  i believe we were  but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means  we were always encouraged to read  and had all the masters that were necessary  those who chose to be idle  certainly might     aye  no doubt  but that is what a governess will prevent  and if i had known your mother  i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one  i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction  and nobody but a governess can give it  it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way  i am always glad to get a young person well placed out  four nieces of mrs  jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means  and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person  who was merely accidentally mentioned to me  and the family are quite delighted with her  mrs  collins  did i tell you of lady metcalf s calling yesterday to thank me  she finds miss pope a treasure   lady catherine   said she   you have given me a treasure   are any of your younger sisters out  miss bennet     yes  ma am  all     all  what  all five out at once  very odd  and you only the second  the younger ones out before the elder ones are married  your younger sisters must be very young     yes  my youngest is not sixteen  perhaps  she  is full young to be much in company  but really  ma am  i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters  that they should not have their share of society and amusement  because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early  the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first  and to be kept back on  such  a motive  i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind     upon my word   said her ladyship   you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person  pray  what is your age     with three younger sisters grown up   replied elizabeth  smiling   your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it    lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer  and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence    you cannot be more than twenty  i am sure  therefore you need not conceal your age     i am not one and twenty    when the gentlemen had joined them  and tea was over  the card tables were placed  lady catherine  sir william  and mr  and mrs  collins sat down to quadrille  and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino  the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs  jenkinson to make up her party  their table was superlatively stupid  scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game  except when mrs  jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh s being too hot or too cold  or having too much or too little light  a great deal more passed at the other table  lady catherine was generally speaking  stating the mistakes of the three others  or relating some anecdote of herself  mr  collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said  thanking her for every fish he won  and apologising if he thought he won too many  sir william did not say much  he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names   when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose  the tables were broken up  the carriage was offered to mrs  collins  gratefully accepted and immediately ordered  the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow  from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach  and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr  collins s side and as many bows on sir william s they departed  as soon as they had driven from the door  elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings  which  for charlotte s sake  she made more favourable than it really was  but her commendation  though costing her some trouble  could by no means satisfy mr  collins  and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship s praise into his own hands     chapter 30   sir william stayed only a week at hunsford  but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter s being most comfortably settled  and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with  while sir william was with them  mr  collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig  and showing him the country  but when he went away  the whole family returned to their usual employments  and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration  for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing  and looking out of the window in his own book room  which fronted the road  the room in which the ladies sat was backwards  elizabeth had at first rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use  it was a better sized room  and had a more pleasant aspect  but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did  for mr  collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment  had they sat in one equally lively  and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement   from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane  and were indebted to mr  collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along  and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton  which he never failed coming to inform them of  though it happened almost every day  she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage  and had a few minutes  conversation with charlotte  but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out   very few days passed in which mr  collins did not walk to rosings  and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise  and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of  she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours  now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship  and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits  she examined into their employments  looked at their work  and advised them to do it differently  found fault with the arrangement of the furniture  or detected the housemaid in negligence  and if she accepted any refreshment  seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs  collins s joints of meat were too large for her family   elizabeth soon perceived  that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county  she was a most active magistrate in her own parish  the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr  collins  and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome  discontented  or too poor  she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences  silence their complaints  and scold them into harmony and plenty   the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week  and  allowing for the loss of sir william  and there being only one card table in the evening  every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first  their other engagements were few  as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond mr  collins s reach  this  however  was no evil to elizabeth  and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough  there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte  and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors  her favourite walk  and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine  was along the open grove which edged that side of the park  where there was a nice sheltered path  which no one seemed to value but herself  and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine s curiosity   in this quiet way  the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away  easter was approaching  and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings  which in so small a circle must be important  elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr  darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks  and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer  his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties  and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley s designs on him were  by his behaviour to his cousin  for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine  who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction  spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration  and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself   his arrival was soon known at the parsonage  for mr  collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane  in order to have the earliest assurance of it  and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park  hurried home with the great intelligence  on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects  there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them  for mr  darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam  the younger son of his uncle lord       and  to the great surprise of all the party  when mr  collins returned  the gentlemen accompanied him  charlotte had seen them from her husband s room  crossing the road  and immediately running into the other  told the girls what an honour they might expect  adding    i may thank you  eliza  for this piece of civility  mr  darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me    elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment  before their approach was announced by the door bell  and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room  colonel fitzwilliam  who led the way  was about thirty  not handsome  but in person and address most truly the gentleman  mr  darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire  paid his compliments  with his usual reserve  to mrs  collins  and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend  met her with every appearance of composure  elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word   colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man  and talked very pleasantly  but his cousin  after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs  collins  sat for some time without speaking to anybody  at length  however  his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of elizabeth after the health of her family  she answered him in the usual way  and after a moment s pause  added    my eldest sister has been in town these three months  have you never happened to see her there    she was perfectly sensible that he never had  but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane  and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet  the subject was pursued no farther  and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away     chapter 31   colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the parsonage  and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at rosings  it was some days  however  before they received any invitation thither  for while there were visitors in the house  they could not be necessary  and it was not till easter day  almost a week after the gentlemen s arrival  that they were honoured by such an attention  and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening  for the last week they had seen very little of lady catherine or her daughter  colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time  but mr  darcy they had seen only at church   the invitation was accepted of course  and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine s drawing room  her ladyship received them civilly  but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else  and she was  in fact  almost engrossed by her nephews  speaking to them  especially to darcy  much more than to any other person in the room   colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them  anything was a welcome relief to him at rosings  and mrs  collins s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much  he now seated himself by her  and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire  of travelling and staying at home  of new books and music  that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before  and they conversed with so much spirit and flow  as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself  as well as of mr  darcy   his  eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity  and that her ladyship  after a while  shared the feeling  was more openly acknowledged  for she did not scruple to call out    what is that you are saying  fitzwilliam  what is it you are talking of  what are you telling miss bennet  let me hear what it is     we are speaking of music  madam   said he  when no longer able to avoid a reply    of music  then pray speak aloud  it is of all subjects my delight  i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music  there are few people in england  i suppose  who have more true enjoyment of music than myself  or a better natural taste  if i had ever learnt  i should have been a great proficient  and so would anne  if her health had allowed her to apply  i am confident that she would have performed delightfully  how does georgiana get on  darcy    mr  darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister s proficiency    i am very glad to hear such a good account of her   said lady catherine   and pray tell her from me  that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal     i assure you  madam   he replied   that she does not need such advice  she practises very constantly     so much the better  it cannot be done too much  and when i next write to her  i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account  i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice  i have told miss bennet several times  that she will never play really well unless she practises more  and though mrs  collins has no instrument  she is very welcome  as i have often told her  to come to rosings every day  and play on the pianoforte in mrs  jenkinson s room  she would be in nobody s way  you know  in that part of the house    mr  darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt s ill breeding  and made no answer   when coffee was over  colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him  and she sat down directly to the instrument  he drew a chair near her  lady catherine listened to half a song  and then talked  as before  to her other nephew  till the latter walked away from her  and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer s countenance  elizabeth saw what he was doing  and at the first convenient pause  turned to him with an arch smile  and said    you mean to frighten me  mr  darcy  by coming in all this state to hear me  i will not be alarmed though your sister  does  play so well  there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others  my courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me     i shall not say you are mistaken   he replied   because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you  and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own    elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself  and said to colonel fitzwilliam   your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me  and teach you not to believe a word i say  i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character  in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit  indeed  mr  darcy  it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire  and  give me leave to say  very impolitic too  for it is provoking me to retaliate  and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear     i am not afraid of you   said he  smilingly    pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of   cried colonel fitzwilliam   i should like to know how he behaves among strangers     you shall hear then  but prepare yourself for something very dreadful  the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire  you must know  was at a ball  and at this ball  what do you think he did  he danced only four dances  though gentlemen were scarce  and  to my certain knowledge  more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner  mr  darcy  you cannot deny the fact     i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party     true  and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room  well  colonel fitzwilliam  what do i play next  my fingers wait your orders     perhaps   said darcy   i should have judged better  had i sought an introduction  but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers     shall we ask your cousin the reason of this   said elizabeth  still addressing colonel fitzwilliam   shall we ask him why a man of sense and education  and who has lived in the world  is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers     i can answer your question   said fitzwilliam   without applying to him  it is because he will not give himself the trouble     i certainly have not the talent which some people possess   said darcy   of conversing easily with those i have never seen before  i cannot catch their tone of conversation  or appear interested in their concerns  as i often see
