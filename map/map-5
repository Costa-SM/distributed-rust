you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone  mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on my aunt phillips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they should be of use to us  she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she _meant_ well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of ones neighbours assistance is impossible condolence insufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied  she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter  he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come with a fare from london and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham if he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make inquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this    chapter 48   the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off  when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel  mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them upthough as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them  all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them  mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it he added that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon there was also a postscript to this effect  i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself if there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence at present we have nothing to guide us colonel forster will i dare say do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person  elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to  every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected the arrival of letters was the grand object of every mornings impatience through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance  but before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise it was as follows  my dear sir  i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire be assured my dear sir that mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortuneor that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parents mind the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family? and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace let me then advise you dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense  i am dear sir etc etc  mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send it was not known that wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living his former acquaintances had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydias relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton he owed a good deal in town but his debts of honour were still more formidable mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family jane heard them with horror a gamester! she cried this is wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it  mr gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday rendered spiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brotherinlaws entreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit when mrs bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before  what is he coming home and without poor lydia? she cried sure he will not leave london before he has found them who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away?  as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and the children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet came from it the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn  mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley  the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from _that_ though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydias infamy somewhat better it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two  when mr bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it  it was not till the afternoon when he had joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that who should suffer but myself? it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it  you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth  you may well warn me against such an evil human nature is so prone to fall into it! no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression it will pass away soon enough  do you suppose them to be in london?  yes where else can they be so well concealed?  and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty  she is happy then said her father drily and her residence there will probably be of some duration  then after a short silence he continued  lizzy i bear you no illwill for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shows some greatness of mind  they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mothers tea  this is a parade he cried which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune! another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my nightcap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away  i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia  _you_ go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne for fifty pounds! no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it no officer is ever to enter into my house again nor even to pass through the village balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner  kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry  well well said he do not make yourself unhappy if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them    chapter 49   two days after mr bennets return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask  what do you mean hill? we have heard nothing from town  dear madam cried mrs hill in great astonishment dont you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner? he has been here this halfhour and master has had a letter  away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech they ran through the vestibule into the breakfastroom from thence to the library their father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said  if you are looking for my master maam he is walking towards the little copse  upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock  jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out  oh papa what newswhat news? have you heard from my uncle?  yes i have had a letter from him by express  well and what news does it bringgood or bad?  what is there of good to be expected? said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it  elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand jane now came up  read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is about  gracechurch street monday august 2  my dear brother  at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope it will give you satisfaction soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were the particulars i reserve till we meet it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both  then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married!  elizabeth read on  i have seen them both they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum these are conditions which considering everything i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer you will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr wickhams circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quiet at longbourn and depend on my diligence and care send back your answer as fast as you can and be careful to write explicitly we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve she comes to us today i shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on yours etc  edw gardiner  is it possible? cried elizabeth when she had finished can it be possible that he will marry her?  wickham is not so undeserving then as we thought him said her sister my dear father i congratulate you  and have you answered the letter? cried elizabeth  no but it must be done soon  most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote  oh! my dear father she cried come back and write immediately consider how important every moment is in such a case  let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble yourself  i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done  and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house  and may i ask said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be complied with  complied with! i am only ashamed of his asking so little  and they _must_ marry! yet he is _such_ a man!  yes yes they must marry there is nothing else to be done but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how am i ever to pay him  money! my uncle! cried jane what do you mean sir?  i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone  that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before his debts to be discharged and something still to remain! oh! it must be my uncles doings! generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself a small sum could not do all this  no said her father wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship  ten thousand pounds! heaven forbid! how is half such a sum to be repaid?  mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house their father then went on to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfastroom  and they are really to be married! cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves how strange this is! and for _this_ we are to be thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia!  i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or anything like it has been advanced he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds?  if he were ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge by this time she is actually with them! if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy! what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt!  we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten  their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor anybody can ever forget it is useless to talk of it  it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied  just as you please  may we take my uncles letter to read to her?  take whatever you like and get away  elizabeth took the letter from his writingtable and they went up stairs together mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet one communication would therefore do for all after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud mrs bennet could hardly contain herself as soon as jane had read mr gardiners hope of lydias being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation to know that her daughter would be married was enough she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct  my dear dear lydia! she cried this is delightful indeed! she will be married! i shall see her again! she will be married at sixteen! my good kind brother! i knew how it would be i knew he would manage everything! how i long to see her! and to see dear wickham too! but the clothes the wedding clothes! i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her stay stay i will go myself ring the bell kitty for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear dear lydia! how merry we shall be together when we meet!  her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardiners behaviour laid them all under  for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money  well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle? if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except a few presents well! i am so happy! in a short time i shall have a daughter married mrs wickham! how well it sounds! and she was only sixteen last june my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate and you write for me we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately  she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted one days delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual other schemes too came into her head  i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs long kitty run down and order the carriage an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i do anything for you in meryton? oh! here comes hill! my dear hill have you heard the good news? miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding  mrs hill began instantly to express her joy elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom  poor lydias situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained    chapter 50   mr bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him he now wished it more than ever had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place  he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brotherinlaw and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could  when first mr bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son the son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs bennet for many years after lydias birth had been certain that he would this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving mrs bennet had no turn for economy and her husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income  five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and the children but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mothers hands lydias expenses had been very little within that sum  that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her  the good news spread quickly through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farmhouse but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain  it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been downstairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance  haye park might do said she if the gouldings could quit itor the great house at stoke if the drawingroom were larger but ashworth is too far off! i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for pulvis lodge the attics are dreadful  her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding into _one_ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn  a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was firm it soon led to another and mrs bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all she could believe possible she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place  elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot  she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters frailty would have mortified her so muchnot however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them had lydias marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned  from such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet  what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex but while he was mortal there must be a triumph  she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgement information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance  but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family  how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture                            * * * * *  mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother to mr bennets acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia  it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on and i think you will agree with me in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my nieces it is mr wickhams intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information? he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her motheryours etc  e gardiner  mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removal from the shire as clearly as mr gardiner could do but mrs bennet was not so well pleased with it lydias being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody and had so many favourites  she is so fond of mrs forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away! and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment  his daughters request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north when mr bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes    chapter 51   their sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself the carriage was sent to meet them at  and they were to return in it by dinnertime their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the culprit and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure  they came the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them smiles decked the face of mrs bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy  lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness  their reception from mr bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there  wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour  there was no want of discourse the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world  only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time good gracious! when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again! though i thought it would be very good fun if i was  her father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh! mamma do the people hereabouts know i am married today? i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the sideglass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like anything  elizabeth could bear it no longer she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah! jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman  it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first her ease and good spirits increased she longed to see mrs phillips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs wickham by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to mrs hill and the two housemaids  well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband? is not he a charming man? i am sure my sisters must all envy me i only hope they may have half my good luck they must all go to brighton that is the place to get husbands what a pity it is mamma we did not all go  very true and if i had my will we should but my dear lydia i dont at all like your going such a way off must it be so?  oh lord! yesthere is nothing in that i shall like it of all things you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all  i should like it beyond anything! said her mother  and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over  i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands  their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them mr wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight  no one but mrs bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not  wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydias for him she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion  lydia was exceedingly fond of him he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him he did every thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than any body else in the country  one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth  lizzy i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding i believe you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it are not you curious to hear how it was managed?  no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said on the subject  la! you are so strange! but i must tell you how it went off we were married you know at st clements because wickhams lodgings were in that parish and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven oclock my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss! i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat  well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if youll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight not one party or scheme or anything to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well  mr darcy! repeated elizabeth in utter amazement  oh yes!he was to come there with wickham you know but gracious me! i quite forgot! i ought not to have said a word about it i promised them so faithfully! what will wickham say? it was to be such a secret!  if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the subject you may depend upon my seeking no further  oh! certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions  thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry  on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away  but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information mr darcy had been at her sisters wedding it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended  you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time pray write instantly and let me understand itunless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance  not that i _shall_ though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out  janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of ittill it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante    chapter 52   elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial  gracechurch street sept 6  my dear niece  i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what i have to tell you i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from _you_ dont think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence your uncle is as much surprised as i amand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit  on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor mr darcy called and was shut up with him several hours it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world his character was to speak for itself he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself if he _had another_ motive i am sure it would never disgrace him he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than _we_ had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us  there is a lady it seems a mrs younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what she then took a large house in edwardstreet and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings this mrs younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her at length however our kind friend procured the wishedfor direction they were in  street he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been _his_ design he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the illconsequences of lydias flight on her own folly alone he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on  mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief  they met several times for there was much to be discussed wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable  every thing being settled between _them_ mr darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home but mr gardiner could not be seen and mr darcy found on further inquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business  on saturday he came again your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together  they met again on sunday and then _i_ saw him too it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn but our visitor was very obstinate i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all he has been accused of many faults at different times but _this_ is the true one nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole  they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most  you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_ and his commission purchased the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was perhaps there was some truth in _this_ though i doubt whether _his_ reserve or _anybodys_ reserve can be answerable for the event but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair  when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish  i believe i have now told you every thing it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house _he_ was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by janes letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her  mr darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and _that_ if he marry _prudently_ his wife may teach him i thought him very slyhe hardly ever mentioned your name but slyness seems the fashion  pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing  but i must write no more the children have been wanting me this half hour  yours very sincerely  m gardiner  the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem her heart did whisper that he had done it for her but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for herfor a woman who had already refused himas able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham brotherinlaw of wickham! every kind of pride must revolt from the connection he had to be sure done much she was ashamed to think how much but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again it was hardly enough but it pleased her she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself  she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some ones approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham  i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister? said he as he joined her  you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome  i should be sorry indeed if it were we were always good friends and now we are better  true are the others coming out?  i do not know mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley  she replied in the affirmative  i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose? poor reynolds she was always very fond of me but of course she did not mention my name to you  yes she did  and what did she say?  that you were gone into the army and she was afraid hadnot turned out well at such a distance as _that_ you know things are strangely misrepresented  certainly he replied biting his lips elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said  i was surprised to see darcy in town last month we passed each other several times i wonder what he can be doing there  perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year  undoubtedly did you see him while you were at lambton? i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had  yes he introduced us to his sister  and do you like her?  very much  i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very glad you liked her i hope she will turn out well  i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age  did you go by the village of kympton?  i do not recollect that we did  i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had a most delightful place!excellent parsonage house! it would have suited me in every respect  how should you have liked making sermons?  exceedingly well i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing one ought not to repinebut to be sure it would have been such a thing for me! the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness! but it was not to be did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent?  i have heard from authority which i thought _as good_ that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron  you have yes there was something in _that_ i told you so from the first you may remember  i _did_ hear too that there was a time when sermonmaking was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly  you did! and it was not wholly without foundation you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it  they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a goodhumoured smile  come mr wickham we are brother and sister you know do not let us quarrel about the past in future i hope we shall be always of one mind  she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house    chapter 53   mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet  the day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth  oh! my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again?  oh lord! i dont know not these two or three years perhaps  write to me very often my dear  as often as i can but you know married women have never much time for writing my sisters may write to _me_ they will have nothing else to do  mr wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things  he is as fine a fellow said mr bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw  the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days  i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with ones friends one seems so forlorn without them  this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single  it is no such thing lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon  but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns  well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister for mrs phillips first brought her the news well so much the better not that i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure _i_ never want to see him again but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it and who knows what _may_ happen? but that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it and so is it quite certain he is coming?  you may depend on it replied the other for mrs nicholls was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday she was going to the butchers she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed  miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said  i saw you look at me today lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed but dont imagine it was from any silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i _should_ be looked at i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him not that i am afraid of _myself_ but i dread other peoples remarks  elizabeth did not know what to make of it had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friends permission or being bold enough to come without it  yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation! i _will_ leave him to himself  in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them  the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again  as soon as ever mr bingley comes my dear said mrs bennet you will wait on him of course  no no you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fools errand again  his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield  tis an etiquette i despise said he if he wants our society let him seek it he knows where we live i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again  well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him but however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him  consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it before _they_ did as the day of his arrival drew near  i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over!  i wish i could say anything to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much  mr bingley arrived mrs bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressingroom window enter the paddock and ride towards the house  her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the windowshe lookedshe saw mr darcy with him and sat down again by her sister  there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be?  some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know  la! replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with him before mr whatshisname that tall proud man  good gracious! mr darcy!and so it does i vow well any friend of mr bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him  jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter both sisters were uncomfortable enough each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingleys friend without being heard by either of them but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs gardiners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley her astonishment at his comingat his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire  the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken but she would not be secure  let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation  she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected on the gentlemens appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance  elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command she had ventured only one glance at darcy he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley but perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture  bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend  elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied  darcy after inquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely anything he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so  could i expect it to be otherwise! said she yet why did he come?  she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak  she inquired after his sister but could do no more  it is a long time mr bingley since you went away said mrs bennet  he readily agreed to it  i began to be afraid you would never come back again people _did_ say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away miss lucas is married and settled and one of my own daughters i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said lately george wickham esq to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or anything it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it did you see it?  bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes how mr darcy looked therefore she could not tell  it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time mr bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars thank heaven! he has _some_ friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves  elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present a few weeks he believed  when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr bennets manor i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you  elizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention! were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion  the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! let me never see either one or the other again!  yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent  when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time  you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement  bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business they then went away  mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year    chapter 54   as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more mr darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her  why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all?  she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure  he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me? if he fears me why come hither? if he no longer cares for me why silent? teasing teasing man! i will think no more about him  her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth  now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance  yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly oh jane take care  my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now?  i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever                            * * * * *  they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hours visit had revived  on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time when they repaired to the diningroom elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided he placed himself by her  elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy with an expression of halflaughing alarm  his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as showed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his own would be speedily secured though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour mr darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them he was on one side of her mother she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did her mothers ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind and she would at times have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family  she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawingroom before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend  if he does not come to me _then_ said she i shall give him up for ever  the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas! the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair and on the gentlemens approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper  the men shant come and part us i am determined we want none of them do we?  darcy had walked away to another part of the room she followed him with her eyes envied everyone to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!  a man who has once been refused! how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!  she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying  is your sister at pemberley still?  yes she will remain there till christmas  and quite alone? have all her friends left her?  mrs annesley is with her the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks  she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young ladys whispering to elizabeth again he walked away  when the teathings were removed and the cardtables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party she now lost every expectation of pleasure they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself  mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them  well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day? i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the venison was roasted to a turnand everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucases last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and what do you think she said besides? ah! mrs bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last she did indeed i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously  mrs bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingleys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals  it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope we may often meet again  elizabeth smiled  lizzy you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifies me i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man  you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment  how hard it is in some cases to be believed!  and how impossible in others!  but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge?  that is a question which i hardly know how to answer we all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidante    chapter 55   a few days after this visit mr bingley called again and alone his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits mrs bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere  next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky  he should be particularly happy at any time etc etc and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them  can you come tomorrow?  yes he had no engagement at all for tomorrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity  he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed in ran mrs bennet to her daughters room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out  my dear jane make haste and hurry down he is comemr bingley is come he is indeed make haste make haste here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown never mind miss lizzys hair  we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago  oh! hang kitty! what has she to do with it? come be quick be quick! where is your sash my dear?  but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters  the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening after tea mr bennet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma? what do you keep winking at me for? what am i to do?  nothing child nothing i did not wink at you she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it in a few minutes mrs bennet halfopened the door and called out  lizzy my dear i want to speak with you  elizabeth was forced to go  we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall kitty and i are going up stairs to sit in my dressingroom  elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawingroom  mrs bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter  he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband  after this day jane said no more of her indifference not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy returned within the stated time seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans concurrence  bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs bennets invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes  but on returning to the drawingroom when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all their situation was awkward enough but _hers_ she thought was still worse not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room  jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world  tis too much! she added by far too much i do not deserve it oh! why is not everybody as happy?  elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present  i must go instantly to my mother she cried i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself he is gone to my father already oh! lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall i bear so much happiness!  she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty  elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation  and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious circumspection! of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance! the happiest wisest most reasonable end!  in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose  where is your sister? said he hastily as he opened the door  with my mother up stairs she will be down in a moment i dare say  he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of janes perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and superexcellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself  it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon mrs bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when mr bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was  not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said  jane i congratulate you you will be a very happy woman  jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness  you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled i have not a doubt of your doing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income  i hope not so imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me  exceed their income! my dear mr bennet cried his wife what are you talking of? why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more then addressing her daughter oh! my dear dear jane i am so happy! i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it would be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!  wickham lydia were all forgotten jane was beyond competition her favourite child at that moment she cared for no other her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense  mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter  bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept  elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief  he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! i had not believed it possible  i suspected as much replied elizabeth but how did he account for it?  it must have been his sisters doing they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other  that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter good girl! it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard  would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!  he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty  this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him  i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed! cried jane oh! lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all! if i could but see _you_ as happy! if there _were_ but such another man for you!
