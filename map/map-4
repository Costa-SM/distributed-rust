passed at hunsford  she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam s and mr  darcy s having both spent three weeks at rosings  and asked him  if he was acquainted with the former   he looked surprised  displeased  alarmed  but with a moment s recollection and a returning smile  replied  that he had formerly seen him often  and  after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man  asked her how she had liked him  her answer was warmly in his favour  with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added    how long did you say he was at rosings     nearly three weeks     and you saw him frequently     yes  almost every day     his manners are very different from his cousin s     yes  very different  but i think mr  darcy improves upon acquaintance     indeed   cried mr  wickham with a look which did not escape her   and pray  may i ask     but checking himself  he added  in a gayer tone   is it in address that he improves  has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style   for i dare not hope   he continued in a lower and more serious tone   that he is improved in essentials     oh  no   said elizabeth   in essentials  i believe  he is very much what he ever was    while she spoke  wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words  or to distrust their meaning  there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention  while she added    when i said that he improved on acquaintance  i did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement  but that  from knowing him better  his disposition was better understood    wickham s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look  for a few minutes he was silent  till  shaking off his embarrassment  he turned to her again  and said in the gentlest of accents    you  who so well know my feeling towards mr  darcy  will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the  appearance  of what is right  his pride  in that direction  may be of service  if not to himself  to many others  for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by  i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you  i imagine  have been alluding  is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt  of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe  his fear of her has always operated  i know  when they were together  and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh  which i am certain he has very much at heart    elizabeth could not repress a smile at this  but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head  she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances  and she was in no humour to indulge him  the rest of the evening passed with the  appearance   on his side  of usual cheerfulness  but with no further attempt to distinguish elizabeth  and they parted at last with mutual civility  and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again   when the party broke up  lydia returned with mrs  forster to meryton  from whence they were to set out early the next morning  the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic  kitty was the only one who shed tears  but she did weep from vexation and envy  mrs  bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter  and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible  advice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to  and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell  the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard     chapter 42   had elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family  she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort  her father  captivated by youth and beauty  and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give  had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her  respect  esteem  and confidence had vanished for ever  and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown  but mr  bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on  in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice  he was fond of the country and of books  and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments  to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted  than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement  this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife  but where other powers of entertainment are wanting  the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given   elizabeth  however  had never been blind to the impropriety of her father s behaviour as a husband  she had always seen it with pain  but respecting his abilities  and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself  she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook  and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which  in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children  was so highly reprehensible  but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage  nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents  talents  which  rightly used  might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters  even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife   when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham s departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment  their parties abroad were less varied than before  and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle  and  though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense  since the disturbers of her brain were removed  her other sister  from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended  was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp  upon the whole  therefore  she found  what has been sometimes found before  that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not  in taking place  bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself  it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity  to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed  and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation  console herself for the present  and prepare for another disappointment  her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts  it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable  and could she have included jane in the scheme  every part of it would have been perfect    but it is fortunate   thought she   that i have something to wish for  were the whole arrangement complete  my disappointment would be certain  but here  by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister s absence  i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised  a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful  and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation    when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty  but her letters were always long expected  and always very short  those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library  where such and such officers had attended them  and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild  that she had a new gown  or a new parasol  which she would have described more fully  but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry  as mrs  forster called her  and they were going off to the camp  and from her correspondence with her sister  there was still less to be learnt  for her letters to kitty  though rather longer  were much too full of lines under the words to be made public   after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence  health  good humour  and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn  everything wore a happier aspect  the families who had been in town for the winter came back again  and summer finery and summer engagements arose  mrs  bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity  and  by the middle of june  kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears  an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day  unless  by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office  another regiment should be quartered in meryton   the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching  and a fortnight only was wanting of it  when a letter arrived from mrs  gardiner  which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent  mr  gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july  and must be in london again within a month  and as that left too short a period for them to go so far  and see so much as they had proposed  or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on  they were obliged to give up the lakes  and substitute a more contracted tour  and  according to the present plan  were to go no farther northwards than derbyshire  in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks  and to mrs  gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction  the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life  and where they were now to spend a few days  was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock  chatsworth  dovedale  or the peak   elizabeth was excessively disappointed  she had set her heart on seeing the lakes  and still thought there might have been time enough  but it was her business to be satisfied  and certainly her temper to be happy  and all was soon right again   with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected  it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner   but surely   said she   i may enter his county with impunity  and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me    the period of expectation was now doubled  four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt s arrival  but they did pass away  and mr  and mrs  gardiner  with their four children  did at length appear at longbourn  the children  two girls of six and eight years old  and two younger boys  were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane  who was the general favourite  and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way  teaching them  playing with them  and loving them   the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn  and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement  one enjoyment was certain  that of suitableness of companions  a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences  cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure  and affection and intelligence  which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad   it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire  nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay  oxford  blenheim  warwick  kenilworth  birmingham  etc  are sufficiently known  a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern  to the little town of lambton  the scene of mrs  gardiner s former residence  and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained  they bent their steps  after having seen all the principal wonders of the country  and within five miles of lambton  elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated  it was not in their direct road  nor more than a mile or two out of it  in talking over their route the evening before  mrs  gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again  mr  gardiner declared his willingness  and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation    my love  should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much   said her aunt   a place  too  with which so many of your acquaintances are connected  wickham passed all his youth there  you know    elizabeth was distressed  she felt that she had no business at pemberley  and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it  she must own that she was tired of seeing great houses  after going over so many  she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains   mrs  gardiner abused her stupidity   if it were merely a fine house richly furnished   said she   i should not care about it myself  but the grounds are delightful  they have some of the finest woods in the country    elizabeth said no more  but her mind could not acquiesce  the possibility of meeting mr  darcy  while viewing the place  instantly occurred  it would be dreadful  she blushed at the very idea  and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk  but against this there were objections  and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource  if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered   accordingly  when she retired at night  she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place  what was the name of its proprietor  and  with no little alarm  whether the family were down for the summer  a most welcome negative followed the last question  and her alarms now being removed  she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself  and when the subject was revived the next morning  and she was again applied to  could readily answer  and with a proper air of indifference  that she had not really any dislike to the scheme  to pemberley  therefore  they were to go     chapter 43   elizabeth  as they drove along  watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation  and when at length they turned in at the lodge  her spirits were in a high flutter   the park was very large  and contained great variety of ground  they entered it in one of its lowest points  and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent   elizabeth s mind was too full for conversation  but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view  they gradually ascended for half a mile  and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence  where the wood ceased  and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house  situated on the opposite side of a valley  into which the road with some abruptness wound  it was a large  handsome stone building  standing well on rising ground  and backed by a ridge of high woody hills  and in front  a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater  but without any artificial appearance  its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned  elizabeth was delighted  she had never seen a place for which nature had done more  or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste  they were all of them warm in their admiration  and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something   they descended the hill  crossed the bridge  and drove to the door  and  while examining the nearer aspect of the house  all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned  she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken  on applying to see the place  they were admitted into the hall  and elizabeth  as they waited for the housekeeper  had leisure to wonder at her being where she was   the housekeeper came  a respectable looking elderly woman  much less fine  and more civil  than she had any notion of finding her  they followed her into the dining parlour  it was a large  well proportioned room  handsomely fitted up  elizabeth  after slightly surveying it  went to a window to enjoy its prospect  the hill  crowned with wood  which they had descended  receiving increased abruptness from the distance  was a beautiful object  every disposition of the ground was good  and she looked on the whole scene  the river  the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley  as far as she could trace it  with delight  as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions  but from every window there were beauties to be seen  the rooms were lofty and handsome  and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor  but elizabeth saw  with admiration of his taste  that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine  with less of splendour  and more real elegance  than the furniture of rosings    and of this place   thought she   i might have been mistress  with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted  instead of viewing them as a stranger  i might have rejoiced in them as my own  and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt  but no    recollecting herself   that could never be  my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me  i should not have been allowed to invite them    this was a lucky recollection  it saved her from something very like regret   she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent  but had not the courage for it  at length however  the question was asked by her uncle  and she turned away with alarm  while mrs  reynolds replied that he was  adding   but we expect him to morrow  with a large party of friends   how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day   her aunt now called her to look at a picture  she approached and saw the likeness of mr  wickham  suspended  amongst several other miniatures  over the mantelpiece  her aunt asked her  smilingly  how she liked it  the housekeeper came forward  and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman  the son of her late master s steward  who had been brought up by him at his own expense   he is now gone into the army   she added   but i am afraid he has turned out very wild    mrs  gardiner looked at her niece with a smile  but elizabeth could not return it    and that   said mrs  reynolds  pointing to another of the miniatures   is my master  and very like him  it was drawn at the same time as the other  about eight years ago     i have heard much of your master s fine person   said mrs  gardiner  looking at the picture   it is a handsome face  but  lizzy  you can tell us whether it is like or not    mrs  reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master    does that young lady know mr  darcy    elizabeth coloured  and said   a little     and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman  ma am     yes  very handsome     i am sure i know none so handsome  but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer  larger picture of him than this  this room was my late master s favourite room  and these miniatures are just as they used to be then  he was very fond of them    this accounted to elizabeth for mr  wickham s being among them   mrs  reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy  drawn when she was only eight years old    and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother   said mrs  gardiner    oh  yes  the handsomest young lady that ever was seen  and so accomplished   she plays and sings all day long  in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her  a present from my master  she comes here to morrow with him    mr  gardiner  whose manners were very easy and pleasant  encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks  mrs  reynolds  either by pride or attachment  had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister    is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year     not so much as i could wish  sir  but i dare say he may spend half his time here  and miss darcy is always down for the summer months     except   thought elizabeth   when she goes to ramsgate     if your master would marry  you might see more of him     yes  sir  but i do not know when  that  will be  i do not know who is good enough for him    mr  and mrs  gardiner smiled  elizabeth could not help saying   it is very much to his credit  i am sure  that you should think so     i say no more than the truth  and everybody will say that knows him   replied the other  elizabeth thought this was going pretty far  and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added   i have never known a cross word from him in my life  and i have known him ever since he was four years old    this was praise  of all others most extraordinary  most opposite to her ideas  that he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion  her keenest attention was awakened  she longed to hear more  and was grateful to her uncle for saying    there are very few people of whom so much can be said  you are lucky in having such a master     yes  sir  i know i am  if i were to go through the world  i could not meet with a better  but i have always observed  that they who are good natured when children  are good natured when they grow up  and he was always the sweetest tempered  most generous hearted boy in the world    elizabeth almost stared at her   can this be mr  darcy   thought she    his father was an excellent man   said mrs  gardiner    yes  ma am  that he was indeed  and his son will be just like him  just as affable to the poor    elizabeth listened  wondered  doubted  and was impatient for more  mrs  reynolds could interest her on no other point  she related the subjects of the pictures  the dimensions of the rooms  and the price of the furniture  in vain  mr  gardiner  highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master  soon led again to the subject  and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase    he is the best landlord  and the best master   said she   that ever lived  not like the wild young men nowadays  who think of nothing but themselves  there is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name  some people call him proud  but i am sure i never saw anything of it  to my fancy  it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men     in what an amiable light does this place him   thought elizabeth    this fine account of him   whispered her aunt as they walked   is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend     perhaps we might be deceived     that is not very likely  our authority was too good    on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sitting room  lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below  and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy  who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley    he is certainly a good brother   said elizabeth  as she walked towards one of the windows   mrs  reynolds anticipated miss darcy s delight  when she should enter the room   and this is always the way with him   she added   whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment  there is nothing he would not do for her    the picture gallery  and two or three of the principal bedrooms  were all that remained to be shown  in the former were many good paintings  but elizabeth knew nothing of the art  and from such as had been already visible below  she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy s  in crayons  whose subjects were usually more interesting  and also more intelligible   in the gallery there were many family portraits  but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger  elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her  at last it arrested her  and she beheld a striking resemblance to mr  darcy  with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her  she stood several minutes before the picture  in earnest contemplation  and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery  mrs  reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father s lifetime   there was certainly at this moment  in elizabeth s mind  a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance  the commendation bestowed on him by mrs  reynolds was of no trifling nature  what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant  as a brother  a landlord  a master  she considered how many people s happiness were in his guardianship   how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow   how much of good or evil must be done by him  every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character  and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented  and fixed his eyes upon herself  she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before  she remembered its warmth  and softened its impropriety of expression   when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen  they returned downstairs  and  taking leave of the housekeeper  were consigned over to the gardener  who met them at the hall door   as they walked across the hall towards the river  elizabeth turned back to look again  her uncle and aunt stopped also  and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building  the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road  which led behind it to the stables   they were within twenty yards of each other  and so abrupt was his appearance  that it was impossible to avoid his sight  their eyes instantly met  and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush  he absolutely started  and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise  but shortly recovering himself  advanced towards the party  and spoke to elizabeth  if not in terms of perfect composure  at least of perfect civility   she had instinctively turned away  but stopping on his approach  received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome  had his first appearance  or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining  been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr  darcy  the gardener s expression of surprise  on beholding his master  must immediately have told it  they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece  who  astonished and confused  scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face  and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family  amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted  every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment  and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind  the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life  nor did he seem much more at ease  when he spoke  his accent had none of its usual sedateness  and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn  and of her having stayed in derbyshire  so often  and in so hurried a way  as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts   at length every idea seemed to fail him  and  after standing a few moments without saying a word  he suddenly recollected himself  and took leave   the others then joined her  and expressed admiration of his figure  but elizabeth heard not a word  and wholly engrossed by her own feelings  followed them in silence  she was overpowered by shame and vexation  her coming there was the most unfortunate  the most ill judged thing in the world  how strange it must appear to him  in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man  it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again  oh  why did she come  or  why did he thus come a day before he was expected  had they been only ten minutes sooner  they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination  for it was plain that he was that moment arrived  that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage  she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting  and his behaviour  so strikingly altered  what could it mean  that he should even speak to her was amazing   but to speak with such civility  to inquire after her family  never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified  never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting  what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park  when he put his letter into her hand  she knew not what to think  or how to account for it   they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water  and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground  or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching  but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it  and  though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt  and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out  she distinguished no part of the scene  her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house  whichever it might be  where mr  darcy then was  she longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind  in what manner he thought of her  and whether  in defiance of everything  she was still dear to him  perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease  yet there had been  that  in his voice which was not like ease  whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell  but he certainly had not seen her with composure   at length  however  the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her  and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself   they entered the woods  and bidding adieu to the river for a while  ascended some of the higher grounds  when  in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander  were many charming views of the valley  the opposite hills  with the long range of woods overspreading many  and occasionally part of the stream  mr  gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park  but feared it might be beyond a walk  with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round  it settled the matter  and they pursued the accustomed circuit  which brought them again  after some time  in a descent among hanging woods  to the edge of the water  and one of its narrowest parts  they crossed it by a simple bridge  in character with the general air of the scene  it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited  and the valley  here contracted into a glen  allowed room only for the stream  and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it  elizabeth longed to explore its windings  but when they had crossed the bridge  and perceived their distance from the house  mrs  gardiner  who was not a great walker  could go no farther  and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible  her niece was  therefore  obliged to submit  and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river  in the nearest direction  but their progress was slow  for mr  gardiner  though seldom able to indulge the taste  was very fond of fishing  and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water  and talking to the man about them  that he advanced but little  whilst wandering on in this slow manner  they were again surprised  and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first  by the sight of mr  darcy approaching them  and at no great distance  the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side  allowed them to see him before they met  elizabeth  however astonished  was at least more prepared for an interview than before  and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness  if he really intended to meet them  for a few moments  indeed  she felt that he would probably strike into some other path  the idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view  the turning past  he was immediately before them  with a glance  she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility  and  to imitate his politeness  she began  as they met  to admire the beauty of the place  but she had not got beyond the words  delightful   and  charming   when some unlucky recollections obtruded  and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed  her colour changed  and she said no more   mrs  gardiner was standing a little behind  and on her pausing  he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends  this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared  and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself   what will be his surprise   thought she   when he knows who they are  he takes them now for people of fashion    the introduction  however  was immediately made  and as she named their relationship to herself  she stole a sly look at him  to see how he bore it  and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions  that he was  surprised  by the connection was evident  he sustained it  however  with fortitude  and so far from going away  turned back with them  and entered into conversation with mr  gardiner  elizabeth could not but be pleased  could not but triumph  it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush  she listened most attentively to all that passed between them  and gloried in every expression  every sentence of her uncle  which marked his intelligence  his taste  or his good manners   the conversation soon turned upon fishing  and she heard mr  darcy invite him  with the greatest civility  to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood  offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle  and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport  mrs  gardiner  who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth  gave her a look expressive of wonder  elizabeth said nothing  but it gratified her exceedingly  the compliment must be all for herself  her astonishment  however  was extreme  and continually was she repeating   why is he so altered  from what can it proceed  it cannot be for  me   it cannot be for  my  sake that his manners are thus softened  my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this  it is impossible that he should still love me    after walking some time in this way  the two ladies in front  the two gentlemen behind  on resuming their places  after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant  there chanced to be a little alteration  it originated in mrs  gardiner  who  fatigued by the exercise of the morning  found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support  and consequently preferred her husband s  mr  darcy took her place by her niece  and they walked on together  after a short silence  the lady first spoke  she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place  and accordingly began by observing  that his arrival had been very unexpected   for your housekeeper   she added   informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow  and indeed  before we left bakewell  we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country   he acknowledged the truth of it all  and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling   they will join me early to morrow   he continued   and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you  mr  bingley and his sisters    elizabeth answered only by a slight bow  her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr  bingley s name had been the last mentioned between them  and  if she might judge by his complexion   his  mind was not very differently engaged    there is also one other person in the party   he continued after a pause   who more particularly wishes to be known to you  will you allow me  or do i ask too much  to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton    the surprise of such an application was great indeed  it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it  she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother  and  without looking farther  it was satisfactory  it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her   they now walked on in silence  each of them deep in thought  elizabeth was not comfortable  that was impossible  but she was flattered and pleased  his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind  they soon outstripped the others  and when they had reached the carriage  mr  and mrs  gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind   he then asked her to walk into the house  but she declared herself not tired  and they stood together on the lawn  at such a time much might have been said  and silence was very awkward  she wanted to talk  but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject  at last she recollected that she had been travelling  and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance  yet time and her aunt moved slowly  and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete a tete was over  on mr  and mrs  gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment  but this was declined  and they parted on each side with utmost politeness  mr  darcy handed the ladies into the carriage  and when it drove off  elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house   the observations of her uncle and aunt now began  and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected   he is perfectly well behaved  polite  and unassuming   said her uncle    there  is  something a little stately in him  to be sure   replied her aunt   but it is confined to his air  and is not unbecoming  i can now say with the housekeeper  that though some people may call him proud  i have seen nothing of it     i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us  it was more than civil  it was really attentive  and there was no necessity for such attention  his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling     to be sure  lizzy   said her aunt   he is not so handsome as wickham  or  rather  he has not wickham s countenance  for his features are perfectly good  but how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable    elizabeth excused herself as well as she could  said that she had liked him better when they had met in kent than before  and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning    but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities   replied her uncle   your great men often are  and therefore i shall not take him at his word  as he might change his mind another day  and warn me off his grounds    elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character  but said nothing    from what we have seen of him   continued mrs  gardiner   i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wickham  he has not an ill natured look  on the contrary  there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks  and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart  but  to be sure  the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character  i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes  but he is a liberal master  i suppose  and  that  in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue    elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham  and therefore gave them to understand  in as guarded a manner as she could  that by what she had heard from his relations in kent  his actions were capable of a very different construction  and that his character was by no means so faulty  nor wickham s so amiable  as they had been considered in hertfordshire  in confirmation of this  she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected  without actually naming her authority  but stating it to be such as might be relied on   mrs  gardiner was surprised and concerned  but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures  every idea gave way to the charm of recollection  and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else  fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance  and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed after many years  discontinuance   the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends  and she could do nothing but think  and think with wonder  of mr  darcy s civility  and  above all  of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister     chapter 44   elizabeth had settled it that mr  darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley  and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning  but her conclusion was false  for on the very morning after their arrival at lambton  these visitors came  they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends  and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family  when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window  and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street  elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery  guessed what it meant  and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected  her uncle and aunt were all amazement  and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke  joined to the circumstance itself  and many of the circumstances of the preceding day  opened to them a new idea on the business  nothing had ever suggested it before  but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece  while these newly born notions were passing in their heads  the perturbation of elizabeth s feelings was at every moment increasing  she was quite amazed at her own discomposure  but amongst other causes of disquiet  she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour  and  more than commonly anxious to please  she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her   she retreated from the window  fearful of being seen  and as she walked up and down the room  endeavouring to compose herself  saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse   miss darcy and her brother appeared  and this formidable introduction took place  with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself  since her being at lambton  she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud  but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy  she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable   miss darcy was tall  and on a larger scale than elizabeth  and  though little more than sixteen  her figure was formed  and her appearance womanly and graceful  she was less handsome than her brother  but there was sense and good humour in her face  and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle  elizabeth  who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr  darcy had been  was much relieved by discerning such different feelings   they had not long been together before mr  darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her  and she had barely time to express her satisfaction  and prepare for such a visitor  when bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs  and in a moment he entered the room  all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away  but had she still felt any  it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again  he inquired in a friendly  though general way  after her family  and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done   to mr  and mrs  gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself  they had long wished to see him  the whole party before them  indeed  excited a lively attention  the suspicions which had just arisen of mr  darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry  and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love  of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt  but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough   elizabeth  on her side  had much to do  she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors  she wanted to compose her own  and to make herself agreeable to all  and in the latter object  where she feared most to fail  she was most sure of success  for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour  bingley was ready  georgiana was eager  and darcy determined  to be pleased   in seeing bingley  her thoughts naturally flew to her sister  and  oh  how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner  sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions  and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that  as he looked at her  he was trying to trace a resemblance  but  though this might be imaginary  she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy  who had been set up as a rival to jane  no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard  nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister  on this point she was soon satisfied  and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted  which  in her anxious interpretation  denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness  and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her  had he dared  he observed to her  at a moment when the others were talking together  and in a tone which had something of real regret  that it  was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her   and  before she could reply  he added   it is above eight months  we have not met since the 26th of november  when we were all dancing together at netherfield    elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact  and he afterwards took occasion to ask her  when unattended to by any of the rest  whether  all  her sisters were at longbourn  there was not much in the question  nor in the preceding remark  but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning   it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr  darcy himself  but  whenever she did catch a glimpse  she saw an expression of general complaisance  and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from  hauteur  or disdain of his companions  as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove  had at least outlived one day  when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace  when she saw him thus civil  not only to herself  but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained  and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage  the difference  the change was so great  and struck so forcibly on her mind  that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible  never  even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield  or his dignified relations at rosings  had she seen him so desirous to please  so free from self consequence or unbending reserve  as now  when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours  and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings   their visitors stayed with them above half an hour  and when they arose to depart  mr  darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr  and mrs  gardiner  and miss bennet  to dinner at pemberley  before they left the country  miss darcy  though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations  readily obeyed  mrs  gardiner looked at her niece  desirous of knowing how  she   whom the invitation most concerned  felt disposed as to its acceptance  but elizabeth had turned away her head  presuming however  that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal  and seeing in her husband  who was fond of society  a perfect willingness to accept it  she ventured to engage for her attendance  and the day after the next was fixed on   bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again  having still a great deal to say to her  and many inquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends  elizabeth  construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister  was pleased  and on this account  as well as some others  found herself  when their visitors left them  capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction  though while it was passing  the enjoyment of it had been little  eager to be alone  and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt  she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley  and then hurried away to dress   but she had no reason to fear mr  and mrs  gardiner s curiosity  it was not their wish to force her communication  it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr  darcy than they had before any idea of  it was evident that he was very much in love with her  they saw much to interest  but nothing to justify inquiry   of mr  darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well  and  as far as their acquaintance reached  there was no fault to find  they could not be untouched by his politeness  and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant s report  without any reference to any other account  the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for mr  darcy  there was now an interest  however  in believing the housekeeper  and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old  and whose own manners indicated respectability  was not to be hastily rejected  neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight  they had nothing to accuse him of but pride  pride he probably had  and if not  it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit  it was acknowledged  however  that he was a liberal man  and did much good among the poor   with respect to wickham  the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation  for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood  it was yet a well known fact that  on his quitting derbyshire  he had left many debts behind him  which mr  darcy afterwards discharged   as for elizabeth  her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last  and the evening  though as it passed it seemed long  was not long enough to determine her feelings towards  one  in that mansion  and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out  she certainly did not hate him  no  hatred had vanished long ago  and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him  that could be so called  the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities  though at first unwillingly admitted  had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling  and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature  by the testimony so highly in his favour  and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light  which yesterday had produced  but above all  above respect and esteem  there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked  it was gratitude  gratitude  not merely for having once loved her  but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him  and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection  he who  she had been persuaded  would avoid her as his greatest enemy  seemed  on this accidental meeting  most eager to preserve the acquaintance  and without any indelicate display of regard  or any peculiarity of manner  where their two selves only were concerned  was soliciting the good opinion of her friends  and bent on making her known to his sister  such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude  for to love  ardent love  it must be attributed  and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged  as by no means unpleasing  though it could not be exactly defined  she respected  she esteemed  she was grateful to him  she felt a real interest in his welfare  and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself  and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power  which her fancy told her she still possessed  of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses   it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece  that such a striking civility as miss darcy s in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley  for she had reached it only to a late breakfast  ought to be imitated  though it could not be equalled  by some exertion of politeness on their side  and  consequently  that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning  they were  therefore  to go  elizabeth was pleased  though when she asked herself the reason  she had very little to say in reply   mr  gardiner left them soon after breakfast  the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before  and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon     chapter 45   convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley s dislike of her had originated in jealousy  she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her  and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady s side the acquaintance would now be renewed   on reaching the house  they were shown through the hall into the saloon  whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer  its windows opening to the ground  admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house  and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn   in this house they were received by miss darcy  who was sitting there with mrs  hurst and miss bingley  and the lady with whom she lived in london  georgiana s reception of them was very civil  but attended with all the embarrassment which  though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong  would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved  mrs  gardiner and her niece  however  did her justice  and pitied her   by mrs  hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey  and  on their being seated  a pause  awkward as such pauses must always be  succeeded for a few moments  it was first broken by mrs  annesley  a genteel  agreeable looking woman  whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others  and between her and mrs  gardiner  with occasional help from elizabeth  the conversation was carried on  miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it  and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard   elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley  and that she could not speak a word  especially to miss darcy  without calling her attention  this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter  had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance  but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much  her own thoughts were employing her  she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room  she wished  she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them  and whether she wished or feared it most  she could scarcely determine  after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingley s voice  elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family  she answered with equal indifference and brevity  and the other said no more   the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat  cake  and a variety of all the finest fruits in season  but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs  annesley to miss darcy had been given  to remind her of her post  there was now employment for the whole party  for though they could not all talk  they could all eat  and the beautiful pyramids of grapes  nectarines  and peaches soon collected them round the table   while thus engaged  elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr  darcy  by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room  and then  though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate  she began to regret that he came   he had been some time with mr  gardiner  who  with two or three other gentlemen from the house  was engaged by the river  and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning  no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed  a resolution the more necessary to be made  but perhaps not the more easily kept  because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them  and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room  in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley s  in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects  for jealousy had not yet made her desperate  and her attentions to mr  darcy were by no means over  miss darcy  on her brother s entrance  exerted herself much more to talk  and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted  and forwarded as much as possible  every attempt at conversation on either side  miss bingley saw all this likewise  and  in the imprudence of anger  took the first opportunity of saying  with sneering civility    pray  miss eliza  are not the     shire militia removed from meryton  they must be a great loss to  your  family    in darcy s presence she dared not mention wickham s name  but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts  and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment s distress  but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack  she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone  while she spoke  an involuntary glance showed her darcy  with a heightened complexion  earnestly looking at her  and his sister overcome with confusion  and unable to lift up her eyes  had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend  she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint  but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial  to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy s opinion  and  perhaps  to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps  not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy s meditated elopement  to no creature had it been revealed  where secrecy was possible  except to elizabeth  and from all bingley s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it  from the very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him  of their becoming hereafter her own  he had certainly formed such a plan  and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet  it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend   elizabeth s collected behaviour  however  soon quieted his emotion  and as miss bingley  vexed and disappointed  dared not approach nearer to wickham  georgiana also recovered in time  though not enough to be able to speak any more  her brother  whose eye she feared to meet  scarcely recollected her interest in the affair  and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully   their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned  and while mr  darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth s person  behaviour  and dress  but georgiana would not join her  her brother s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour  his judgement could not err  and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable  when darcy returned to the saloon  miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister    how very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning  mr  darcy   she cried   i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter  she is grown so brown and coarse  louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again    however little mr  darcy might have liked such an address  he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned  no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer    for my own part   she rejoined   i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her  her face is too thin  her complexion has no brilliancy  and her features are not at all handsome  her nose wants character  there is nothing marked in its lines  her teeth are tolerable  but not out of the common way  and as for her eyes  which have sometimes been called so fine  i could never see anything extraordinary in them  they have a sharp  shrewish look  which i do not like at all  and in her air altogether there is a self sufficiency without fashion  which is intolerable    persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth  this was not the best method of recommending herself  but angry people are not always wise  and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled  she had all the success she expected  he was resolutely silent  however  and  from a determination of making him speak  she continued    i remember  when we first knew her in hertfordshire  how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty  and i particularly recollect your saying one night  after they had been dining at netherfield    she  a beauty   i should as soon call her mother a wit   but afterwards she seemed to improve on you  and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time     yes   replied darcy  who could contain himself no longer   but  that  was only when i first saw her  for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance    he then went away  and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself   mrs  gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit  as they returned  except what had particularly interested them both  the look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed  except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention  they talked of his sister  his friends  his house  his fruit  of everything but himself  yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs  gardiner thought of him  and mrs  gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece s beginning the subject     chapter 46   elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton  and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there  but on the third her repining was over  and her sister justified  by the receipt of two letters from her at once  on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere  elizabeth was not surprised at it  as jane had written the direction remarkably ill   they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in  and her uncle and aunt  leaving her to enjoy them in quiet  set off by themselves  the one missent must first be attended to  it had been written five days ago  the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements  with such news as the country afforded  but the latter half  which was dated a day later  and written in evident agitation  gave more important intelligence  it was to this effect    since writing the above  dearest lizzy  something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature  but i am afraid of alarming you  be assured that we are all well  what i have to say relates to poor lydia  an express came at twelve last night  just as we were all gone to bed  from colonel forster  to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers  to own the truth  with wickham  imagine our surprise  to kitty  however  it does not seem so wholly unexpected  i am very  very sorry  so imprudent a match on both sides  but i am willing to hope the best  and that his character has been misunderstood  thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him  but this step  and let us rejoice over it  marks nothing bad at heart  his choice is disinterested at least  for he must know my father can give her nothing  our poor mother is sadly grieved  my father bears it better  how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him  we must forget it ourselves  they were off saturday night about twelve  as is conjectured  but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight  the express was sent off directly  my dear lizzy  they must have passed within ten miles of us  colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon  lydia left a few lines for his wife  informing her of their intention  i must conclude  for i cannot be long from my poor mother  i am afraid you will not be able to make it out  but i hardly know what i have written    without allowing herself time for consideration  and scarcely knowing what she felt  elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other  and opening it with the utmost impatience  read as follows  it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first    by this time  my dearest sister  you have received my hurried letter  i wish this may be more intelligible  but though not confined for time  my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent  dearest lizzy  i hardly know what i would write  but i have bad news for you  and it cannot be delayed  imprudent as the marriage between mr  wickham and our poor lydia would be  we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place  for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland  colonel forster came yesterday  having left brighton the day before  not many hours after the express  though lydia s short letter to mrs  f  gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green  something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w  never intended to go there  or to marry lydia at all  which was repeated to colonel f   who  instantly taking the alarm  set off from b  intending to trace their route  he did trace them easily to clapham  but no further  for on entering that place  they removed into a hackney coach  and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom  all that is known after this is  that they were seen to continue the london road  i know not what to think  after making every possible inquiry on that side london  colonel f  came on into hertfordshire  anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes  and at the inns in barnet and hatfield  but without any success  no such people had been seen to pass through  with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn  and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart  i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs  f   but no one can throw any blame on them  our distress  my dear lizzy  is very great  my father and mother believe the worst  but i cannot think so ill of him  many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan  and even if  he  could form such a design against a young woman of lydia s connections  which is not likely  can i suppose her so lost to everything  impossible  i grieve to find  however  that colonel f  is not disposed to depend upon their marriage  he shook his head when i expressed my hopes  and said he feared w  was not a man to be trusted  my poor mother is really ill  and keeps her room  could she exert herself  it would be better  but this is not to be expected  and as to my father  i never in my life saw him so affected  poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment  but as it was a matter of confidence  one cannot wonder  i am truly glad  dearest lizzy  that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes  but now  as the first shock is over  shall i own that i long for your return  i am not so selfish  however  as to press for it  if inconvenient  adieu  i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not  but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible  i know my dear uncle and aunt so well  that i am not afraid of requesting it  though i have still something more to ask of the former  my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly  to try to discover her  what he means to do i am sure i know not  but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way  and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening  in such an exigence  my uncle s advice and assistance would be everything in the world  he will immediately comprehend what i must feel  and i rely upon his goodness     oh  where  where is my uncle   cried elizabeth  darting from her seat as she finished the letter  in eagerness to follow him  without losing a moment of the time so precious  but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant  and mr  darcy appeared  her pale face and impetuous manner made him start  and before he could recover himself to speak  she  in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia s situation  hastily exclaimed   i beg your pardon  but i must leave you  i must find mr  gardiner this moment  on business that cannot be delayed  i have not an instant to lose     good god  what is the matter   cried he  with more feeling than politeness  then recollecting himself   i will not detain you a minute  but let me  or let the servant go after mr  and mrs  gardiner  you are not well enough  you cannot go yourself    elizabeth hesitated  but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them  calling back the servant  therefore  she commissioned him  though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible  to fetch his master and mistress home instantly   on his quitting the room she sat down  unable to support herself  and looking so miserably ill  that it was impossible for darcy to leave her  or to refrain from saying  in a tone of gentleness and commiseration   let me call your maid  is there nothing you could take to give you present relief  a glass of wine  shall i get you one  you are very ill     no  i thank you   she replied  endeavouring to recover herself   there is nothing the matter with me  i am quite well  i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn    she burst into tears as she alluded to it  and for a few minutes could not speak another word  darcy  in wretched suspense  could only say something indistinctly of his concern  and observe her in compassionate silence  at length she spoke again   i have just had a letter from jane  with such dreadful news  it cannot be concealed from anyone  my younger sister has left all her friends  has eloped  has thrown herself into the power of  of mr  wickham  they are gone off together from brighton   you  know him too well to doubt the rest  she has no money  no connections  nothing that can tempt him to  she is lost for ever    darcy was fixed in astonishment   when i consider   she added in a yet more agitated voice   that i might have prevented it  i  who knew what he was  had i but explained some part of it only  some part of what i learnt  to my own family  had his character been known  this could not have happened  but it is all  all too late now     i am grieved indeed   cried darcy   grieved  shocked  but is it certain  absolutely certain     oh  yes  they left brighton together on sunday night  and were traced almost to london  but not beyond  they are certainly not gone to scotland     and what has been done  what has been attempted  to recover her     my father is gone to london  and jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance  and we shall be off  i hope  in half an hour  but nothing can be done  i know very well that nothing can be done  how is such a man to be worked on  how are they even to be discovered  i have not the smallest hope  it is every way horrible    darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence    when  my  eyes were opened to his real character  oh  had i known what i ought  what i dared to do  but i knew not  i was afraid of doing too much  wretched  wretched mistake    darcy made no answer  he seemed scarcely to hear her  and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation  his brow contracted  his air gloomy  elizabeth soon observed  and instantly understood it  her power was sinking  everything  must  sink under such a proof of family weakness  such an assurance of the deepest disgrace  she could neither wonder nor condemn  but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom  afforded no palliation of her distress  it was  on the contrary  exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes  and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him  as now  when all love must be vain   but self  though it would intrude  could not engross her  lydia  the humiliation  the misery she was bringing on them all  soon swallowed up every private care  and covering her face with her handkerchief  elizabeth was soon lost to everything else  and  after a pause of several minutes  was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion  who  in a manner which  though it spoke compassion  spoke likewise restraint  said   i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence  nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my stay  but real  though unavailing concern  would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress  but i will not torment you with vain wishes  which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks  this unfortunate affair will  i fear  prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day     oh  yes  be so kind as to apologise for us to miss darcy  say that urgent business calls us home immediately  conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible  i know it cannot be long    he readily assured her of his secrecy  again expressed his sorrow for her distress  wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope  and leaving his compliments for her relations  with only one serious  parting look  went away   as he quitted the room  elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire  and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance  so full of contradictions and varieties  sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance  and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination   if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection  elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty  but if otherwise  if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural  in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object  and even before two words have been exchanged  nothing can be said in her defence  except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham  and that its ill success might  perhaps  authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment  be that as it may  she saw him go with regret  and in this early example of what lydia s infamy must produce  found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business  never  since reading jane s second letter  had she entertained a hope of wickham s meaning to marry her  no one but jane  she thought  could flatter herself with such an expectation  surprise was the least of her feelings on this development  while the contents of the first letter remained in her mind  she was all surprise  all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money  and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible  but now it was all too natural  for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms  and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage  she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey   she had never perceived  while the regiment was in hertfordshire  that lydia had any partiality for him  but she was convinced that lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody  sometimes one officer  sometimes another  had been her favourite  as their attentions raised them in her opinion  her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object  the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl  oh  how acutely did she now feel it   she was wild to be at home  to hear  to see  to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her  in a family so deranged  a father absent  a mother incapable of exertion  and requiring constant attendance  and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia  her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost importance  and till he entered the room her impatience was severe  mr  and mrs  gardiner had hurried back in alarm  supposing by the servant s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill  but satisfying them instantly on that head  she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons  reading the two letters aloud  and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy   though lydia had never been a favourite with them  mr  and mrs  gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted  not lydia only  but all were concerned in it  and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror  mr  gardiner promised every assistance in his power  elizabeth  though expecting no less  thanked him with tears of gratitude  and all three being actuated by one spirit  everything relating to their journey was speedily settled  they were to be off as soon as possible   but what is to be done about pemberley   cried mrs  gardiner   john told us mr  darcy was here when you sent for us  was it so     yes  and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement   that  is all settled     what is all settled   repeated the other  as she ran into her room to prepare   and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth  oh  that i knew how it was    but wishes were vain  or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour  had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle  she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself  but she had her share of business as well as her aunt  and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at lambton  with false excuses for their sudden departure  an hour  however  saw the whole completed  and mr  gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn  nothing remained to be done but to go  and elizabeth  after all the misery of the morning  found herself  in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed  seated in the carriage  and on the road to longbourn     chapter 47    i have been thinking it over again  elizabeth   said her uncle  as they drove from the town   and really  upon serious consideration  i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter  it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless  and who was actually staying in his colonel s family  that i am strongly inclined to hope the best  could he expect that her friends would not step forward  could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment  after such an affront to colonel forster  his temptation is not adequate to the risk     do you really think so   cried elizabeth  brightening up for a moment    upon my word   said mrs  gardiner   i begin to be of your uncle s opinion  it is really too great a violation of decency  honour  and interest  for him to be guilty of  i cannot think so very ill of wickham  can you yourself  lizzy  so wholly give him up  as to believe him capable of it     not  perhaps  of neglecting his own interest  but of every other neglect i can believe him capable  if  indeed  it should be so  but i dare not hope it  why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case     in the first place   replied mr  gardiner   there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland     oh  but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption  and  besides  no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road     well  then  supposing them to be in london  they may be there  though for the purpose of concealment  for no more exceptional purpose  it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side  and it might strike them that they could be more economically  though less expeditiously  married in london than in scotland     but why all this secrecy  why any fear of detection  why must their marriage be private  oh  no  no  this is not likely  his most particular friend  you see by jane s account  was persuaded of his never intending to marry her  wickham will never marry a woman without some money  he cannot afford it  and what claims has lydia  what attraction has she beyond youth  health  and good humour that could make him  for her sake  forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well  as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her  i am not able to judge  for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce  but as to your other objection  i am afraid it will hardly hold good  lydia has no brothers to step forward  and he might imagine  from my father s behaviour  from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family  that  he  would do as little  and think as little about it  as any father could do  in such a matter     but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage     it does seem  and it is most shocking indeed   replied elizabeth  with tears in her eyes   that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt  but  really  i know not what to say  perhaps i am not doing her justice  but she is very young  she has never been taught to think on serious subjects  and for the last half year  nay  for a twelvemonth  she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity  she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner  and to adopt any opinions that came in her way  since the     shire were first quartered in meryton  nothing but love  flirtation  and officers have been in her head  she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject  to give greater  what shall i call it  susceptibility to her feelings  which are naturally lively enough  and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman     but you see that jane   said her aunt   does not think so very ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt     of whom does jane ever think ill  and who is there  whatever might be their former conduct  that she would think capable of such an attempt  till it were proved against them  but jane knows  as well as i do  what wickham really is  we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word  that he has neither integrity nor honour  that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating     and do you really know all this   cried mrs  gardiner  whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive    i do indeed   replied elizabeth  colouring   i told you  the other day  of his infamous behaviour to mr  darcy  and you yourself  when last at longbourn  heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him  and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty  which it is not worth while to relate  but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless  from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud  reserved  disagreeable girl  yet he knew to the contrary himself  he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her     but does lydia know nothing of this  can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand     oh  yes   that  that is the worst of all  till i was in kent  and saw so much both of mr  darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam  i was ignorant of the truth myself  and when i returned home  the     shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time  as that was the case  neither jane  to whom i related the whole  nor i  thought it necessary to make our knowledge public  for of what use could it apparently be to any one  that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown  and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs  forster  the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me  that  she  could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head  that such a consequence as  this  could ensue  you may easily believe  was far enough from my thoughts     when they all removed to brighton  therefore  you had no reason  i suppose  to believe them fond of each other     not the slightest  i can remember no symptom of affection on either side  and had anything of the kind been perceptible  you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away  when first he entered the corps  she was ready enough to admire him  but so we all were  every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months  but he never distinguished  her  by any particular attention  and  consequently  after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration  her fancy for him gave way  and others of the regiment  who treated her with more distinction  again became her favourites                              * * * * *  it may be easily believed  that however little of novelty could be added to their fears  hopes  and conjectures  on this interesting subject  by its repeated discussion  no other could detain them from it long  during the whole of the journey  from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent  fixed there by the keenest of all anguish  self reproach  she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness   they travelled as expeditiously as possible  and  sleeping one night on the road  reached longbourn by dinner time the next day  it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations   the little gardiners  attracted by the sight of a chaise  were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock  and  when the carriage drove up to the door  the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces  and displayed itself over their whole bodies  in a variety of capers and frisks  was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome   elizabeth jumped out  and  after giving each of them a hasty kiss  hurried into the vestibule  where jane  who came running down from her mother s apartment  immediately met her   elizabeth  as she affectionately embraced her  whilst tears filled the eyes of both  lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives    not yet   replied jane   but now that my dear uncle is come  i hope everything will be well     is my father in town     yes  he went on tuesday  as i wrote you word     and have you heard from him often     we have heard only twice  he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety  and to give me his directions  which i particularly begged him to do  he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention     and my mother  how is she  how are you all     my mother is tolerably well  i trust  though her spirits are greatly shaken  she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all  she does not yet leave her dressing room  mary and kitty  thank heaven  are quite well     but you  how are you   cried elizabeth   you look pale  how much you must have gone through    her sister  however  assured her of her being perfectly well  and their conversation  which had been passing while mr  and mrs  gardiner were engaged with their children  was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party  jane ran to her uncle and aunt  and welcomed and thanked them both  with alternate smiles and tears   when they were all in the drawing room  the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others  and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give  the sanguine hope of good  however  which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her  she still expected that it would all end well  and that every morning would bring some letter  either from lydia or her father  to explain their proceedings  and  perhaps  announce their marriage   mrs  bennet  to whose apartment they all repaired  after a few minutes  conversation together  received them exactly as might be expected  with tears and lamentations of regret  invectives against the villainous conduct of wickham  and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage  blaming everybody but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing    if i had been able   said she   to carry my point in going to brighton  with all my family   this  would not have happened  but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her  why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight  i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side  for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after  i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her  but i was overruled  as i always am  poor dear child  and now here s mr  bennet gone away  and i know he will fight wickham  wherever he meets him and then he will be killed  and what is to become of us all  the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave  and if you are not kind to us  brother  i do not know what we shall do    they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas  and mr  gardiner  after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family  told her that he meant to be in london the very next day  and would assist mr  bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia    do not give way to useless alarm   added he   though it is right to be prepared for the worst  there is no occasion to look on it as certain  it is not quite a week since they left brighton  in a few days more we may gain some news of them  and till we know that they are not married  and have no design of marrying  do not let us give the matter over as lost  as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother  and make him come home with me to gracechurch street  and then we may consult together as to what is to be done     oh  my dear brother   replied mrs  bennet   that is exactly what i could most wish for  and now do  when you get to town  find them out  wherever they may be  and if they are not married already   make  them marry  and as for wedding clothes  do not let them wait for that  but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them  after they are married  and  above all  keep mr  bennet from fighting  tell him what a dreadful state i am in  that i am frighted out of my wits  and have such tremblings  such flutterings  all over me  such spasms in my side and pains in my head  and such beatings at heart  that i can get no rest by night nor by day  and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me  for she does not know which are the best warehouses  oh  brother  how kind you are  i know you will contrive it all    but mr  gardiner  though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause  could not avoid recommending moderation to her  as well in her hopes as her fear  and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table  they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper  who attended in the absence of her daughters   though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family  they did not attempt to oppose it  for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants  while they waited at table  and judged it better that  one  only of the household  and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject   in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty  who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before  one came from her books  and the other from her toilette  the faces of both  however  were tolerably calm  and no change was visible in either  except that the loss of her favourite sister  or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business  had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty  as for mary  she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth  with a countenance of grave reflection  soon after they were seated at table    this is a most unfortunate affair  and will probably be much talked of  but we must stem the tide of malice  and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation    then  perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying  she added   unhappy as the event must be for lydia  we may draw from it this useful lesson  that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable  that one false step involves her in endless ruin  that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful  and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex    elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement  but was too much oppressed to make any reply  mary  however  continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them   in the afternoon  the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves  and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries  which jane was equally eager to satisfy  after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event  which elizabeth considered as all but certain  and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible  the former continued the subject  by saying   but tell me all and everything about it which i have not already heard  give me further particulars  what did colonel forster say  had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place  they must have seen them together for ever     colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality  especially on lydia s side  but nothing to give him any alarm  i am so grieved for him  his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost  he  was  coming to us  in order to assure us of his concern  before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland  when that apprehension first got abroad  it hastened his journey     and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry  did he know of their intending to go off  had colonel forster seen denny himself     yes  but  when questioned by  him   denny denied knowing anything of their plans  and would not give his real opinion about it  he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying  and from  that   i am inclined to hope  he might have been misunderstood before     and till colonel forster came himself  not one of you entertained a doubt  i suppose  of their being really married     how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains  i felt a little uneasy  a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage  because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right  my father and mother knew nothing of that  they only felt how imprudent a match it must be  kitty then owned  with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us  that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step  she had known  it seems  of their being in love with each other  many weeks     but not before they went to brighton     no  i believe not     and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself  does he know his real character     i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did  he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant  and since this sad affair has taken place  it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt  but i hope this may be false     oh  jane  had we been less secret  had we told what we knew of him  this could not have happened     perhaps it would have been better   replied her sister   but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were  seemed unjustifiable  we acted with the best intentions     could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia s note to his wife     he brought it with him for us to see    jane then took it from her pocket book  and gave it to elizabeth  these were the contents    my dear harriet    you will laugh when you know where i am gone  and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning  as soon as i am missed  i am going to gretna green  and if you cannot guess with who  i shall think you a simpleton  for there is but one man in the world i love  and he is an angel  i should never be happy without him  so think it no harm to be off  you need not send them word at longbourn of my going  if you do not like it  for it will make the surprise the greater  when i write to them and sign my name  lydia wickham   what a good joke it will be  i can hardly write for laughing  pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement  and dancing with him to night  tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all  and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet  with great pleasure  i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn  but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up  good bye  give my love to colonel forster  i hope you will drink to our good journey    your affectionate friend    lydia bennet     oh  thoughtless  thoughtless lydia   cried elizabeth when she had finished it   what a letter is this  to be written at such a moment  but at least it shows that  she  was serious on the subject of their journey  whatever he might afterwards persuade her to  it was not on her side a  scheme  of infamy  my poor father  how he must have felt it     i never saw anyone so shocked  he could not speak a word for full ten minutes  my mother was taken ill immediately  and the whole house in such confusion     oh  jane   cried elizabeth   was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day     i do not know  i hope there was  but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult  my mother was in hysterics  and though i endeavoured to give her every
