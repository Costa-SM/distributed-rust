how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival to jane no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield  elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning  it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgracewhen she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonagethe difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from selfconsequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings  their visitors stayed with them above halfanhour and when they arose to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed mrs gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how _she_ whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on  bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many inquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last halfhour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little eager to be alone and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress  but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiners curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her they saw much to interest but nothing to justify inquiry  of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for mr darcy there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small markettown where the family did not visit it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor  with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a wellknown fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr darcy afterwards discharged  as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out she certainly did not hate him no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked it was gratitude gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitudefor to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses  it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece that such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning they were therefore to go elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply  mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon    chapter 45   convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed  on reaching the house they were shown through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn  in this house they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with all the embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved mrs gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her  by mrs hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments it was first broken by mrs annesley a genteel agreeablelooking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly wellbred than either of the others and between her and mrs gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard  elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much her own thoughts were employing her she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more  the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post there was now employment for the whole partyfor though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table  while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came  he had been some time with mr gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingleys in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr darcy were by no means over miss darcy on her brothers entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility  pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton? they must be a great loss to _your_ family  in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone while she spoke an involuntary glance showed her darcy with a heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcys meditated elopement to no creature had it been revealed where secrecy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingleys connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from the very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend  elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully  their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person behaviour and dress but georgiana would not join her her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgement could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister  how very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy she cried i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter she is grown so brown and coarse! louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again  however little mr darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer  for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome her nose wants characterthere is nothing marked in its lines her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i could never see anything extraordinary in them they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiency without fashion which is intolerable  persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued  i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield _she_ a beauty!i should as soon call her mother a wit but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time  yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but _that_ was only when i first saw her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance  he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself  mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both the look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruitof everything but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject    chapter 46   elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill  they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves the one missent must first be attended to it had been written five days ago the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence it was to this effect  since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming yoube assured that we are all well what i have to say relates to poor lydia an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham! imagine our surprise to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected i am very very sorry so imprudent a match on both sides! but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing our poor mother is sadly grieved my father bears it better how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written  without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first  by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed imprudent as the marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express though lydias short letter to mrs f gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off from b intending to trace their route he did trace them easily to clapham but no further for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road i know not what to think after making every possible inquiry on that side london colonel f came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any successno such people had been seen to pass through with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs f but no one can throw any blame on them our distress my dear lizzy is very great my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to everything? impossible! i grieve to find however that colonel f is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w was not a man to be trusted my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return? i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient adieu! i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again tomorrow evening in such an exigence my uncles advice and assistance would be everything in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness  oh! where where is my uncle? cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared her pale face and impetuous manner made him start and before he could recover himself to speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you i must find mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose  good god! what is the matter? cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you are not well enough you cannot go yourself  elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly  on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief? a glass of wine shall i get you one? you are very ill  no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself there is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn  she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence at length she spoke again i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from anyone my younger sister has left all her friendshas eloped has thrown herself into the power ofof mr wickham they are gone off together from brighton _you_ know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him toshe is lost for ever  darcy was fixed in astonishment when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it! i who knew what he was had i but explained some part of it onlysome part of what i learnt to my own family! had his character been known this could not have happened but it is allall too late now  i am grieved indeed cried darcy grievedshocked but is it certainabsolutely certain?  oh yes! they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland  and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her?  my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncles immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in halfanhour but nothing can be donei know very well that nothing can be done how is such a man to be worked on? how are they even to be discovered? i have not the smallest hope it is every way horrible!  darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence  when _my_ eyes were opened to his real characteroh! had i known what i ought what i dared to do! but i knew noti was afraid of doing too much wretched wretched mistake!  darcy made no answer he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it her power was sinking everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain  but self though it would intrude could not engross her lydiathe humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to everything else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress! but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley today  oh yes be so kind as to apologise for us to miss darcy say that urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it cannot be long  he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away  as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination  if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty but if otherwiseif regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydias infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business never since reading janes second letter had she entertained a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation surprise was the least of her feelings on this development while the contents of the first letter remained in her mind she was all surpriseall astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible but now it was all too natural for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey  she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girloh! how acutely did she now feel it!  she was wild to be at hometo hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room her impatience was severe mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energythough lydia had never been a favourite with them mr and mrs gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr gardiner promised every assistance in his power elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit everything relating to their journey was speedily settled they were to be off as soon as possible but what is to be done about pemberley? cried mrs gardiner john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us was it so?  yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement _that_ is all settled  what is all settled? repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth? oh that i knew how it was!  but wishes were vain or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure an hour however saw the whole completed and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn    chapter 47   i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward? could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster? his temptation is not adequate to the risk!  do you really think so? cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment  upon my word said mrs gardiner i begin to be of your uncles opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it?  not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so! but i dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case?  in the first place replied mr gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland  oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption! and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road  well thensupposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptional purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland  but why all this secrecy? why any fear of detection? why must their marriage be private? oh no nothis is not likely his most particular friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydiawhat attraction has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathers behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that _he_ would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter  but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?  it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last halfyear nay for a twelvemonthshe has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greaterwhat shall i call it? susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman  but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so very ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt  of whom does jane ever think ill? and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would think capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them? but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating  and do you really know all this? cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive  i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other circumstances which i am not at libertywhich it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her  but does lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand?  oh yes!that that is the worst of all till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me that _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head that such a consequence as _this_ could ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts  when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other?  not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had anything of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites                            * * * * *  it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent fixed there by the keenest of all anguish selfreproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness  they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations  the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome  elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them a hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down from her mothers apartment immediately met her  elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives  not yet replied jane but now that my dear uncle is come i hope everything will be well  is my father in town?  yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word  and have you heard from him often?  we have heard only twice he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention  and my motherhow is she? how are you all?  my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all she does not yet leave her dressingroom mary and kitty thank heaven are quite well  but youhow are you? cried elizabeth you look pale how much you must have gone through!  her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears  when they were all in the drawingroom the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce their marriage  mrs bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villainous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and illusage blaming everybody but the person to whose illjudging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing  if i had been able said she to carry my point in going to brighton with all my family _this_ would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight? i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was overruled as i always am poor dear child! and now heres mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all? the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do  they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia  do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done  oh! my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already _make_ them marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them after they are married and above all keep mr bennet from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frighted out of my witsand have such tremblings such flutterings all over mesuch spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are! i know you will contrive it all  but mr gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fear and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters  though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that _one_ only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject  in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before one came from her books and the other from her toilette the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table  this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation  then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex  elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them  in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for halfanhour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and everything about it which i have not already heard give me further particulars what did colonel forster say? had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place? they must have seen them together for ever  colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him! his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he _was_ coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey  and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry? did he know of their intending to go off? had colonel forster seen denny himself?  yes but when questioned by _him_ denny denied knowing anything of their plans and would not give his real opinion about it he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marryingand from _that_ i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before  and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married?  how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?
