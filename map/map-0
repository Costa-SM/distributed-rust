prejudice  by jane austen    chapter 1   it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife  however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters  my dear mr bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at last?  mr bennet replied that he had not  but it is returned she for mrs long has just been here and she told me all about it  mr bennet made no answer  do you not want to know who has taken it? cried his wife impatiently  _you_ want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it  this was invitation enough  why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week  what is his name?  bingley  is he married or single?  oh! single my dear to be sure! a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls!  how so? how can it affect them?  my dear mr bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome! you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them  is that his design in settling here?  design! nonsense how can you talk so! but it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes  i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr bingley may like you the best of the party  my dear you flatter me i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now when a woman has five grownup daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty  in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of  but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood  it is more than i engage for i assure you  but consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would be for one of them sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no newcomers indeed you must go for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him if you do not  you are overscrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy  i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so goodhumoured as lydia but you are always giving _her_ the preference  they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters  mr bennet how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? you take delight in vexing me you have no compassion for my poor nerves  you mistake me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves they are my old friends i have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least  ah you do not know what i suffer  but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood  it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them  depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all  mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of threeandtwenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character _her_ mind was less difficult to develop she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news    chapter 2   mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it it was then disclosed in the following manner observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with  i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy  we are not in a way to know _what_ mr bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit  but you forget mamma said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long promised to introduce him  i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two nieces of her own she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her  no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you  mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters  dont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake! have a little compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces  kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill  i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully when is your next ball to be lizzy?  tomorrow fortnight  aye so it is cried her mother and mrs long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself  then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to _her_  impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teasing?  i honour your circumspection a fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight but if _we_ do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs long and her neices must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself  the girls stared at their father mrs bennet said only nonsense nonsense!  what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation? cried he do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense? i cannot quite agree with you _there_ what say you mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts  mary wished to say something sensible but knew not how  while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr bingley  i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife  i am sorry to hear _that_ but why did not you tell me that before? if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now  the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while  how good it was in you my dear mr bennet! but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am! and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now  now kitty you may cough as much as you choose said mr bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife  what an excellent father you have girls! said she when the door was shut i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintances every day but for your sakes we would do anything lydia my love though you _are_ the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball  oh! said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i _am_ the youngest im the tallest  the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner    chapter 3   not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley they attacked him in various wayswith barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas her report was highly favourable sir william had been delighted with him he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party nothing could be more delightful! to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr bingleys heart were entertained  if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for  in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennets visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse  an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation etc mrs bennet was quite disconcerted she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from londonhis five sisters and a cousin and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogethermr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man  mr bingley was goodlooking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion his brotherinlaw mr hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend  mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield such amiable qualities must speak for themselves what a contrast between him and his friend! mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party his character was decided he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there again amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters  elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and mr bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it  come darcy said he i must have you dance i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much better dance  i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with  i would not be so fastidious as you are cried mr bingley for a kingdom! upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty  _you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet  oh! she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld! but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce you  which do you mean? and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt _me_ i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me  mr bingley followed his advice mr darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculous  the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party mr bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way elizabeth felt janes pleasure mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants they found mr bennet still up with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations he had rather hoped that his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear  oh! my dear mr bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball i wish you had been there jane was so admired nothing could be like it everybody said how well she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice! only think of _that_ my dear he actually danced with her twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time first of all he asked miss lucas i was so vexed to see him stand up with her! but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance so he inquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the _boulanger_  if he had had any compassion for _me_ cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much! for gods sake say no more of his partners oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!  oh! my dear i am quite delighted with him he is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses i dare say the lace upon mrs hursts gown  here she was interrupted again mr bennet protested against any description of finery she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr darcy  but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great! not handsome enough to dance with! i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your setdowns i quite detest the man    chapter 4   when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him  he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible goodhumoured lively and i never saw such happy manners!so much ease with such perfect good breeding!  he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can his character is thereby complete  i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i did not expect such a compliment  did not you? i did for you but that is one great difference between us compliments always take _you_ by surprise and _me_ never what could be more natural than his asking you again? he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a stupider person  dear lizzy!  oh! you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general you never see a fault in anybody all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life  i would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone but i always speak what i think  i know you do and it is _that_ which makes the wonder with _your_ good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! affectation of candour is common enoughone meets with it everywhere but to be candid without ostentation or designto take the good of everybodys character and make it still better and say nothing of the badbelongs to you alone and so you like this mans sisters too do you? their manners are not equal to his  certainly notat first but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her  elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it but proud and conceited they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade  mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it mr bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase  his sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now only established as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his tablenor was mrs hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her mr bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house he did look at it and into it for halfanhourwas pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately  between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of great opposition of character bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness and ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied on the strength of darcys regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgement the highest opinion in understanding darcy was the superior bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though wellbred were not inviting in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offense  the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life everybody had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much  mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they would not object to know more of miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose    chapter 5   within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and in quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to everybody by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st jamess had made him courteous  lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennet they had several children the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven was elizabeths intimate friend  that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate  _you_ began the evening well charlotte said mrs bennet with civil selfcommand to miss lucas _you_ were mr bingleys first choice  yes but he seemed to like his second better  oh! you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired herindeed i rather believe he _did_i heard something about itbut i hardly know whatsomething about mr robinson  perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you? mr robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question oh! the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point  upon my word! well that is very decided indeedthat does seem as ifbut however it may all come to nothing you know  _my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_ eliza said charlotte mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he?poor eliza!to be only just _tolerable_  i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for halfanhour without once opening his lips  are you quite sure maam?is not there a little mistake? said jane i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her  ayebecause she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to  miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintances with _them_ he is remarkably agreeable  i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise  i do not mind his not talking to mrs long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza  another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with _him_ if i were you  i believe maam i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him  his pride said miss lucas does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune everything in his favour should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a _right_ to be proud  that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive _his_ pride if he had not mortified _mine_  pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonymously a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us  if i were as rich as mr darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine a day  then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly  the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit    chapter 6   the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield the visit was soon returned in due form miss bennets pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of mrs hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration it was generally evident whenever they met that he _did_ admire her and to _her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas  it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all _begin_ freelya slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_ affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on  but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too  remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do  but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out  perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should therefore make the most of every halfhour in which she can command his attention when she is secure of him there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses  your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it but these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness she has known him only a fortnight she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined with him in company four times this is not quite enough to make her understand his character  not as you represent it had she merely _dined_ with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent togetherand four evenings may do a great deal  yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingtun better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded  well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the least they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life  you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself  occupied in observing mr bingleys attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with  he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others his doing so drew her notice it was at sir william lucass where a large party were assembled  what does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster?  that is a question which mr darcy only can answer  but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him  on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said  did you not think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton?  with great energy but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic  you are severe on us  it will be _her_ turn soon to be teased said miss lucas i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows  you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers on miss lucass persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must and gravely glancing at mr darcy there is a fine old saying which everybody here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song  her performance was pleasing though by no means capital after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display  mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room  mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began  what a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcy! there is nothing like dancing after all i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society  certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world every savage can dance  sir william only smiled your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy  you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir  yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do you often dance at st jamess?  never sir  do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?  it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it  you have a house in town i conclude?  mr darcy bowed  i had once had some thought of fixing in town myselffor i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas  he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her  my dear miss eliza why are you not dancing? mr darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you and taking her hand he would have given it to mr darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william  indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner  mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion  you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one halfhour  mr darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling  he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisancefor who would object to such a partner?  elizabeth looked archly and turned away her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley  i can guess the subject of your reverie  i should imagine not  you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this mannerin such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion i was never more annoyed! the insipidity and yet the noisethe nothingness and yet the selfimportance of all those people! what would i give to hear your strictures on them!  your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was more agreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow  miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections mr darcy replied with great intrepidity  miss elizabeth bennet  miss elizabeth bennet! repeated miss bingley i am all astonishment how long has she been such a favourite?and pray when am i to wish you joy?  that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask a ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment i knew you would be wishing me joy  nay if you are serious about it i shall consider the matter is absolutely settled you will be having a charming motherinlaw indeed and of course she will always be at pemberley with you  he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long    chapter 7   mr bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mothers fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds  she had a sister married to a mr phillips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade  the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the headquarters  their visits to mrs phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves mr phillips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before they could talk of nothing but officers and mr bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign  after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr bennet coolly observed  from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced  catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london  i am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightingly of anybodys children it should not be of my own however  if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it  yesbut as it happens they are all of them very clever  this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish  my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very welland indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his regimentals  mamma cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library  mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer mrs bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read  well jane who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love  it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud  my dear friend  if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole days teteatete between two women can never end without a quarrel come as soon as you can on receipt of this my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officersyours ever  caroline bingley  with the officers! cried lydia i wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_  dining out said mrs bennet that is very unlucky  can i have the carriage? said jane  no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night  that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home  oh! but the gentlemen will have mr bingleys chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs  i had much rather go in the coach  but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure they are wanted in the farm mr bennet are they not?  they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them  but if you have got them today said elizabeth my mothers purpose will be answered  she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back  this was a lucky idea of mine indeed! said mrs bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth  my dearest lizzy  i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday my kind friends will not hear of my returning till i am better they insist also on my seeing mr jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to meand excepting a sore throat and headache there is not much the matter with meyours etc  well my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illnessif she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders  oh! i am not afraid of her dying people do not die of little trifling colds she will be taken good care of as long as she stays there it is all very well i would go and see her if i could have the carriage  elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walking was her only alternative she declared her resolution  how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt! you will not be fit to be seen when you get there  i shall be very fit to see janewhich is all i want  is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses?
