done     my fingers   said elizabeth   do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do  they have not the same force or rapidity  and do not produce the same expression  but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault  because i will not take the trouble of practising  it is not that i do not believe  my  fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution    darcy smiled and said   you are perfectly right  you have employed your time much better  no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting  we neither of us perform to strangers    here they were interrupted by lady catherine  who called out to know what they were talking of  elizabeth immediately began playing again  lady catherine approached  and  after listening for a few minutes  said to darcy    miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more  and could have the advantage of a london master  she has a very good notion of fingering  though her taste is not equal to anne s  anne would have been a delightful performer  had her health allowed her to learn    elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin s praise  but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love  and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley  that he might have been just as likely to marry  her   had she been his relation   lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance  mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste  elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility  and  at the request of the gentlemen  remained at the instrument till her ladyship s carriage was ready to take them all home     chapter 32   elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning  and writing to jane while mrs  collins and maria were gone on business into the village  when she was startled by a ring at the door  the certain signal of a visitor  as she had heard no carriage  she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine  and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions  when the door opened  and  to her very great surprise  mr  darcy  and mr  darcy only  entered the room   he seemed astonished too on finding her alone  and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within   they then sat down  and when her inquiries after rosings were made  seemed in danger of sinking into total silence  it was absolutely necessary  therefore  to think of something  and in this emergence recollecting  when  she had seen him last in hertfordshire  and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure  she observed    how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november  mr  darcy  it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr  bingley to see you all after him so soon  for  if i recollect right  he went but the day before  he and his sisters were well  i hope  when you left london     perfectly so  i thank you    she found that she was to receive no other answer  and  after a short pause added    i think i have understood that mr  bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again     i have never heard him say so  but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future  he has many friends  and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing     if he means to be but little at netherfield  it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely  for then we might possibly get a settled family there  but  perhaps  mr  bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own  and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle     i should not be surprised   said darcy   if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers    elizabeth made no answer  she was afraid of talking longer of his friend  and  having nothing else to say  was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him   he took the hint  and soon began with   this seems a very comfortable house  lady catherine  i believe  did a great deal to it when mr  collins first came to hunsford     i believe she did  and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object     mr  collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife     yes  indeed  his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him  or have made him happy if they had  my friend has an excellent understanding  though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr  collins as the wisest thing she ever did  she seems perfectly happy  however  and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her     it must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends     an easy distance  do you call it  it is nearly fifty miles     and what is fifty miles of good road  little more than half a day s journey  yes  i call it a  very  easy distance     i should never have considered the distance as one of the  advantages  of the match   cried elizabeth   i should never have said mrs  collins was settled  near  her family     it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire  anything beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn  i suppose  would appear far    as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood  he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield  and she blushed as she answered    i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family  the far and the near must be relative  and depend on many varying circumstances  where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant  distance becomes no evil  but that is not the case  here   mr  and mrs  collins have a comfortable income  but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys  and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself  near  her family under less than  half  the present distance    mr  darcy drew his chair a little towards her  and said    you  cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment   you  cannot have been always at longbourn    elizabeth looked surprised  the gentleman experienced some change of feeling  he drew back his chair  took a newspaper from the table  and glancing over it  said  in a colder voice    are you pleased with kent    a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued  on either side calm and concise  and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister  just returned from her walk  the tete a tete surprised them  mr  darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet  and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody  went away    what can be the meaning of this   said charlotte  as soon as he was gone   my dear  eliza  he must be in love with you  or he would never have called us in this familiar way    but when elizabeth told of his silence  it did not seem very likely  even to charlotte s wishes  to be the case  and after various conjectures  they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do  which was the more probable from the time of year  all field sports were over  within doors there was lady catherine  books  and a billiard table  but gentlemen cannot always be within doors  and in the nearness of the parsonage  or the pleasantness of the walk to it  or of the people who lived in it  the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day  they called at various times of the morning  sometimes separately  sometimes together  and now and then accompanied by their aunt  it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society  a persuasion which of course recommended him still more  and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him  as well as by his evident admiration of her  of her former favourite george wickham  and though  in comparing them  she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners  she believed he might have the best informed mind   but why mr  darcy came so often to the parsonage  it was more difficult to understand  it could not be for society  as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips  and when he did speak  it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice  a sacrifice to propriety  not a pleasure to himself  he seldom appeared really animated  mrs  collins knew not what to make of him  colonel fitzwilliam s occasionally laughing at his stupidity  proved that he was generally different  which her own knowledge of him could not have told her  and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love  and the object of that love her friend eliza  she set herself seriously to work to find it out  she watched him whenever they were at rosings  and whenever he came to hunsford  but without much success  he certainly looked at her friend a great deal  but the expression of that look was disputable  it was an earnest  steadfast gaze  but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it  and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind   she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her  but elizabeth always laughed at the idea  and mrs  collins did not think it right to press the subject  from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment  for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt  that all her friend s dislike would vanish  if she could suppose him to be in her power    in her kind schemes for elizabeth  she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam  he was beyond comparison the most pleasant man  he certainly admired her  and his situation in life was most eligible  but  to counterbalance these advantages  mr  darcy had considerable patronage in the church  and his cousin could have none at all     chapter 33   more than once did elizabeth  in her ramble within the park  unexpectedly meet mr  darcy  she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought  and  to prevent its ever happening again  took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers  how it could occur a second time  therefore  was very odd  yet it did  and even a third  it seemed like wilful ill nature  or a voluntary penance  for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away  but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her  he never said a great deal  nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much  but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions  about her pleasure in being at hunsford  her love of solitary walks  and her opinion of mr  and mrs  collins s happiness  and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house  he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying  there  too  his words seemed to imply it  could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts  she supposed  if he meant anything  he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter  it distressed her a little  and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage   she was engaged one day as she walked  in perusing jane s last letter  and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits  when  instead of being again surprised by mr  darcy  she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her  putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile  she said    i did not know before that you ever walked this way     i have been making the tour of the park   he replied   as i generally do every year  and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage  are you going much farther     no  i should have turned in a moment    and accordingly she did turn  and they walked towards the parsonage together    do you certainly leave kent on saturday   said she    yes  if darcy does not put it off again  but i am at his disposal  he arranges the business just as he pleases     and if not able to please himself in the arrangement  he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice  i do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr  darcy     he likes to have his own way very well   replied colonel fitzwilliam   but so we all do  it is only that he has better means of having it than many others  because he is rich  and many others are poor  i speak feelingly  a younger son  you know  must be inured to self denial and dependence     in my opinion  the younger son of an earl can know very little of either  now seriously  what have you ever known of self denial and dependence  when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose  or procuring anything you had a fancy for     these are home questions  and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature  but in matters of greater weight  i may suffer from want of money  younger sons cannot marry where they like     unless where they like women of fortune  which i think they very often do     our habits of expense make us too dependent  and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money     is this   thought elizabeth   meant for me   and she coloured at the idea  but  recovering herself  said in a lively tone   and pray  what is the usual price of an earl s younger son  unless the elder brother is very sickly  i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds    he answered her in the same style  and the subject dropped  to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed  she soon afterwards said    i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal  i wonder he does not marry  to secure a lasting convenience of that kind  but  perhaps  his sister does as well for the present  and  as she is under his sole care  he may do what he likes with her     no   said colonel fitzwilliam   that is an advantage which he must divide with me  i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy     are you indeed  and pray what sort of guardians do you make  does your charge give you much trouble  young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage  and if she has the true darcy spirit  she may like to have her own way    as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly  and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness  convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth  she directly replied    you need not be frightened  i never heard any harm of her  and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world  she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance  mrs  hurst and miss bingley  i think i have heard you say that you know them     i know them a little  their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man  he is a great friend of darcy s     oh  yes   said elizabeth drily   mr  darcy is uncommonly kind to mr  bingley  and takes a prodigious deal of care of him     care of him  yes  i really believe darcy  does  take care of him in those points where he most wants care  from something that he told me in our journey hither  i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him  but i ought to beg his pardon  for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant  it was all conjecture     what is it you mean     it is a circumstance which darcy could not wish to be generally known  because if it were to get round to the lady s family  it would be an unpleasant thing     you may depend upon my not mentioning it     and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley  what he told me was merely this  that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage  but without mentioning names or any other particulars  and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort  and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer     did mr  darcy give you reasons for this interference     i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady     and what arts did he use to separate them     he did not talk to me of his own arts   said fitzwilliam  smiling   he only told me what i have now told you    elizabeth made no answer  and walked on  her heart swelling with indignation  after watching her a little  fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful    i am thinking of what you have been telling me   said she   your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings  why was he to be the judge     you are rather disposed to call his interference officious     i do not see what right mr  darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination  or why  upon his own judgement alone  he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy  but   she continued  recollecting herself   as we know none of the particulars  it is not fair to condemn him  it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case     that is not an unnatural surmise   said fitzwilliam   but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly    this was spoken jestingly  but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr  darcy  that she would not trust herself with an answer  and therefore  abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the parsonage  there  shut into her own room  as soon as their visitor left them  she could think without interruption of all that she had heard  it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected  there could not exist in the world  two  men over whom mr  darcy could have such boundless influence  that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate bingley and jane she had never doubted  but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them  if his own vanity  however  did not mislead him   he  was the cause  his pride and caprice were the cause  of all that jane had suffered  and still continued to suffer  he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate  generous heart in the world  and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted    there were some very strong objections against the lady   were colonel fitzwilliam s words  and those strong objections probably were  her having one uncle who was a country attorney  and another who was in business in london    to jane herself   she exclaimed   there could be no possibility of objection  all loveliness and goodness as she is   her understanding excellent  her mind improved  and her manners captivating  neither could anything be urged against my father  who  though with some peculiarities  has abilities mr  darcy himself need not disdain  and respectability which he will probably never reach   when she thought of her mother  her confidence gave way a little  but she would not allow that any objections  there  had material weight with mr  darcy  whose pride  she was convinced  would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend s connections  than from their want of sense  and she was quite decided  at last  that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride  and partly by the wish of retaining mr  bingley for his sister   the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned  brought on a headache  and it grew so much worse towards the evening  that  added to her unwillingness to see mr  darcy  it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings  where they were engaged to drink tea  mrs  collins  seeing that she was really unwell  did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her  but mr  collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine s being rather displeased by her staying at home     chapter 34   when they were gone  elizabeth  as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr  darcy  chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent  they contained no actual complaint  nor was there any revival of past occurrences  or any communication of present suffering  but in all  and in almost every line of each  there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style  and which  proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone  had been scarcely ever clouded  elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness  with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal  mr  darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict  gave her a keener sense of her sister s sufferings  it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next  and  a still greater  that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again  and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits  by all that affection could do   she could not think of darcy s leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him  but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all  and agreeable as he was  she did not mean to be unhappy about him   while settling this point  she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell  and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself  who had once before called late in the evening  and might now come to inquire particularly after her  but this idea was soon banished  and her spirits were very differently affected  when  to her utter amazement  she saw mr  darcy walk into the room  in an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health  imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better  she answered him with cold civility  he sat down for a few moments  and then getting up  walked about the room  elizabeth was surprised  but said not a word  after a silence of several minutes  he came towards her in an agitated manner  and thus began    in vain i have struggled  it will not do  my feelings will not be repressed  you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you    elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression  she stared  coloured  doubted  and was silent  this he considered sufficient encouragement  and the avowal of all that he felt  and had long felt for her  immediately followed  he spoke well  but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed  and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride  his sense of her inferiority  of its being a degradation  of the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination  were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding  but was very unlikely to recommend his suit   in spite of her deeply rooted dislike  she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man s affection  and though her intentions did not vary for an instant  she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive  till  roused to resentment by his subsequent language  she lost all compassion in anger  she tried  however  to compose herself to answer him with patience  when he should have done  he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which  in spite of all his endeavours  he had found impossible to conquer  and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand  as he said this  she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer  he  spoke  of apprehension and anxiety  but his countenance expressed real security  such a circumstance could only exasperate farther  and  when he ceased  the colour rose into her cheeks  and she said    in such cases as this  it is  i believe  the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed  however unequally they may be returned  it is natural that obligation should be felt  and if i could  feel  gratitude  i would now thank you  but i cannot  i have never desired your good opinion  and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly  i am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone  it has been most unconsciously done  however  and i hope will be of short duration  the feelings which  you tell me  have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard  can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation    mr  darcy  who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face  seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise  his complexion became pale with anger  and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature  he was struggling for the appearance of composure  and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it  the pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful  at length  with a voice of forced calmness  he said    and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting  i might  perhaps  wish to be informed why  with so little  endeavour  at civility  i am thus rejected  but it is of small importance     i might as well inquire   replied she   why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me  you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will  against your reason  and even against your character  was not this some excuse for incivility  if i  was  uncivil  but i have other provocations  you know i have  had not my feelings decided against you  had they been indifferent  or had they even been favourable  do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining  perhaps for ever  the happiness of a most beloved sister    as she pronounced these words  mr  darcy changed colour  but the emotion was short  and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued    i have every reason in the world to think ill of you  no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted  there   you dare not  you cannot deny  that you have been the principal  if not the only means of dividing them from each other  of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability  and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes  and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind    she paused  and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse  he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity    can you deny that you have done it   she repeated   with assumed tranquillity he then replied   i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister  or that i rejoice in my success  towards  him  i have been kinder than towards myself    elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection  but its meaning did not escape  nor was it likely to conciliate her    but it is not merely this affair   she continued   on which my dislike is founded  long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided  your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr  wickham  on this subject  what can you have to say  in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself  or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others     you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns   said darcy  in a less tranquil tone  and with a heightened colour    who that knows what his misfortunes have been  can help feeling an interest in him     his misfortunes   repeated darcy contemptuously   yes  his misfortunes have been great indeed     and of your infliction   cried elizabeth with energy   you have reduced him to his present state of poverty  comparative poverty  you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him  you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert  you have done all this  and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule     and this   cried darcy  as he walked with quick steps across the room   is your opinion of me  this is the estimation in which you hold me  i thank you for explaining it so fully  my faults  according to this calculation  are heavy indeed  but perhaps   added he  stopping in his walk  and turning towards her   these offenses might have been overlooked  had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design  these bitter accusations might have been suppressed  had i  with greater policy  concealed my struggles  and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified  unalloyed inclination  by reason  by reflection  by everything  but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence  nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related  they were natural and just  could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections   to congratulate myself on the hope of relations  whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own    elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment  yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said    you are mistaken  mr  darcy  if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way  than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you  had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner    she saw him start at this  but he said nothing  and she continued    you could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it    again his astonishment was obvious  and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification  she went on    from the very beginning  from the first moment  i may almost say  of my acquaintance with you  your manners  impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance  your conceit  and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others  were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike  and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry     you have said quite enough  madam  i perfectly comprehend your feelings  and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been  forgive me for having taken up so much of your time  and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness    and with these words he hastily left the room  and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house   the tumult of her mind  was now painfully great  she knew not how to support herself  and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour  her astonishment  as she reflected on what had passed  was increased by every review of it  that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr  darcy  that he should have been in love with her for so many months  so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend s marrying her sister  and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case  was almost incredible  it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection  but his pride  his abominable pride  his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane  his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging  though he could not justify it  and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr  wickham  his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny  soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited  she continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of lady catherine s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte s observation  and hurried her away to her room     chapter 35   elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes  she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened  it was impossible to think of anything else  and  totally indisposed for employment  she resolved  soon after breakfast  to indulge herself in air and exercise  she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk  when the recollection of mr  darcy s sometimes coming there stopped her  and instead of entering the park  she turned up the lane  which led farther from the turnpike road  the park paling was still the boundary on one side  and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground   after walking two or three times along that part of the lane  she was tempted  by the pleasantness of the morning  to stop at the gates and look into the park  the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country  and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees  she was on the point of continuing her walk  when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park  he was moving that way  and  fearful of its being mr  darcy  she was directly retreating  but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her  and stepping forward with eagerness  pronounced her name  she had turned away  but on hearing herself called  though in a voice which proved it to be mr  darcy  she moved again towards the gate  he had by that time reached it also  and  holding out a letter  which she instinctively took  said  with a look of haughty composure   i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you  will you do me the honour of reading that letter   and then  with a slight bow  turned again into the plantation  and was soon out of sight   with no expectation of pleasure  but with the strongest curiosity  elizabeth opened the letter  and  to her still increasing wonder  perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper  written quite through  in a very close hand  the envelope itself was likewise full  pursuing her way along the lane  she then began it  it was dated from rosings  at eight o clock in the morning  and was as follows      be not alarmed  madam  on receiving this letter  by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you  i write without any intention of paining you  or humbling myself  by dwelling on wishes which  for the happiness of both  cannot be too soon forgotten  and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion  should have been spared  had not my character required it to be written and read  you must  therefore  pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention  your feelings  i know  will bestow it unwillingly  but i demand it of your justice    two offenses of a very different nature  and by no means of equal magnitude  you last night laid to my charge  the first mentioned was  that  regardless of the sentiments of either  i had detached mr  bingley from your sister  and the other  that i had  in defiance of various claims  in defiance of honour and humanity  ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr  wickham  wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth  the acknowledged favourite of my father  a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage  and who had been brought up to expect its exertion  would be a depravity  to which the separation of two young persons  whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks  could bear no comparison  but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed  respecting each circumstance  i shall hope to be in the future secured  when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read  if  in the explanation of them  which is due to myself  i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours  i can only say that i am sorry  the necessity must be obeyed  and further apology would be absurd    i had not been long in hertfordshire  before i saw  in common with others  that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country  but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment  i had often seen him in love before  at that ball  while i had the honour of dancing with you  i was first made acquainted  by sir william lucas s accidental information  that bingley s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage  he spoke of it as a certain event  of which the time alone could be undecided  from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively  and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him  your sister i also watched  her look and manners were open  cheerful  and engaging as ever  but without any symptom of peculiar regard  and i remained convinced from the evening s scrutiny  that though she received his attentions with pleasure  she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment  if  you  have not been mistaken here   i  must have been in error  your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable  if it be so  if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her  your resentment has not been unreasonable  but i shall not scruple to assert  that the serenity of your sister s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that  however amiable her temper  her heart was not likely to be easily touched  that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain  but i will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears  i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it  i believed it on impartial conviction  as truly as i wished it in reason  my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside  in my own case  the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me  but there were other causes of repugnance  causes which  though still existing  and existing to an equal degree in both instances  i had myself endeavoured to forget  because they were not immediately before me  these causes must be stated  though briefly  the situation of your mother s family  though objectionable  was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently  so almost uniformly betrayed by herself  by your three younger sisters  and occasionally even by your father  pardon me  it pains me to offend you  but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations  and your displeasure at this representation of them  let it give you consolation to consider that  to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure  is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister  than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both  i will only say farther that from what passed that evening  my opinion of all parties was confirmed  and every inducement heightened which could have led me before  to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection  he left netherfield for london  on the day following  as you  i am certain  remember  with the design of soon returning    the part which i acted is now to be explained  his sisters  uneasiness had been equally excited with my own  our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered  and  alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother  we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london  we accordingly went  and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice  i described  and enforced them earnestly  but  however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination  i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage  had it not been seconded by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving  of your sister s indifference  he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere  if not with equal regard  but bingley has great natural modesty  with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own  to convince him  therefore  that he had deceived himself  was no very difficult point  to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire  when that conviction had been given  was scarcely the work of a moment  i cannot blame myself for having done thus much  there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction  it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister s being in town  i knew it myself  as it was known to miss bingley  but her brother is even yet ignorant of it  that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable  but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger  perhaps this concealment  this disguise was beneath me  it is done  however  and it was done for the best  on this subject i have nothing more to say  no other apology to offer  if i have wounded your sister s feelings  it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient  i have not yet learnt to condemn them    with respect to that other  more weighty accusation  of having injured mr  wickham  i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family  of what he has  particularly  accused me i am ignorant  but of the truth of what i shall relate  i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity    mr  wickham is the son of a very respectable man  who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates  and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him  and on george wickham  who was his godson  his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed  my father supported him at school  and afterwards at cambridge  most important assistance  as his own father  always poor from the extravagance of his wife  would have been unable to give him a gentleman s education  my father was not only fond of this young man s society  whose manners were always engaging  he had also the highest opinion of him  and hoping the church would be his profession  intended to provide for him in it  as for myself  it is many  many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner  the vicious propensities  the want of principle  which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend  could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself  and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments  which mr  darcy could not have  here again i shall give you pain  to what degree you only can tell  but whatever may be the sentiments which mr  wickham has created  a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character  it adds even another motive    my excellent father died about five years ago  and his attachment to mr  wickham was to the last so steady  that in his will he particularly recommended it to me  to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow  and if he took orders  desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant  there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds  his own father did not long survive mine  and within half a year from these events  mr  wickham wrote to inform me that  having finally resolved against taking orders  he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage  in lieu of the preferment  by which he could not be benefited  he had some intention  he added  of studying law  and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein  i rather wished  than believed him to be sincere  but  at any rate  was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal  i knew that mr  wickham ought not to be a clergyman  the business was therefore soon settled  he resigned all claim to assistance in the church  were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it  and accepted in return three thousand pounds  all connection between us seemed now dissolved  i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley  or admit his society in town  in town i believe he chiefly lived  but his studying the law was a mere pretence  and being now free from all restraint  his life was a life of idleness and dissipation  for about three years i heard little of him  but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him  he applied to me again by letter for the presentation  his circumstances  he assured me  and i had no difficulty in believing it  were exceedingly bad  he had found the law a most unprofitable study  and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained  if i would present him to the living in question  of which he trusted there could be little doubt  as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for  and i could not have forgotten my revered father s intentions  you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty  or for resisting every repetition to it  his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances  and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself  after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped  how he lived i know not  but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice    i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself  and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being  having said thus much  i feel no doubt of your secrecy  my sister  who is more than ten years my junior  was left to the guardianship of my mother s nephew  colonel fitzwilliam  and myself  about a year ago  she was taken from school  and an establishment formed for her in london  and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it  to ramsgate  and thither also went mr  wickham  undoubtedly by design  for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs  younge  in whose character we were most unhappily deceived  and by her connivance and aid  he so far recommended himself to georgiana  whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child  that she was persuaded to believe herself in love  and to consent to an elopement  she was then but fifteen  which must be her excuse  and after stating her imprudence  i am happy to add  that i owed the knowledge of it to herself  i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement  and then georgiana  unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father  acknowledged the whole to me  you may imagine what i felt and how i acted  regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure  but i wrote to mr  wickham  who left the place immediately  and mrs  younge was of course removed from her charge  mr  wickham s chief object was unquestionably my sister s fortune  which is thirty thousand pounds  but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement  his revenge would have been complete indeed    this  madam  is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together  and if you do not absolutely reject it as false  you will  i hope  acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr  wickham  i know not in what manner  under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you  but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at  ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either  detection could not be in your power  and suspicion certainly not in your inclination    you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night  but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed  for the truth of everything here related  i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam  who  from our near relationship and constant intimacy  and  still more  as one of the executors of my father s will  has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions  if your abhorrence of  me  should make  my  assertions valueless  you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin  and that there may be the possibility of consulting him  i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning  i will only add  god bless you    fitzwilliam darcy     chapter 36   if elizabeth  when mr  darcy gave her the letter  did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers  she had formed no expectation at all of its contents  but such as they were  it may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them  and what a contrariety of emotion they excited  her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined  with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power  and steadfastly was she persuaded  that he could have no explanation to give  which a just sense of shame would not conceal  with a strong prejudice against everything he might say  she began his account of what had happened at netherfield  she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension  and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring  was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes  his belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false  and his account of the real  the worst objections to the match  made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice  he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her  his style was not penitent  but haughty  it was all pride and insolence   but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr  wickham  when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which  if true  must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth  and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself  her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition  astonishment  apprehension  and even horror  oppressed her  she wished to discredit it entirely  repeatedly exclaiming   this must be false  this cannot be  this must be the grossest falsehood    and when she had gone through the whole letter  though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two  put it hastily away  protesting that she would not regard it  that she would never look in it again   in this perturbed state of mind  with thoughts that could rest on nothing  she walked on  but it would not do  in half a minute the letter was unfolded again  and collecting herself as well as she could  she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham  and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence  the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself  and the kindness of the late mr  darcy  though she had not before known its extent  agreed equally well with his own words  so far each recital confirmed the other  but when she came to the will  the difference was great  what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory  and as she recalled his very words  it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other  and  for a few moments  she flattered herself that her wishes did not err  but when she read and re read with the closest attention  the particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living  of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds  again was she forced to hesitate  she put down the letter  weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality  deliberated on the probability of each statement  but with little success  on both sides it was only assertion  again she read on  but every line proved more clearly that the affair  which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr  darcy s conduct in it less than infamous  was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole   the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at mr  wickham s charge  exceedingly shocked her  the more so  as she could bring no proof of its injustice  she had never heard of him before his entrance into the     shire militia  in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who  on meeting him accidentally in town  had there renewed a slight acquaintance  of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself  as to his real character  had information been in her power  she had never felt a wish of inquiring  his countenance  voice  and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue  she tried to recollect some instance of goodness  some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence  that might rescue him from the attacks of mr  darcy  or at least  by the predominance of virtue  atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr  darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years  continuance  but no such recollection befriended her  she could see him instantly before her  in every charm of air and address  but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood  and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess  after pausing on this point a considerable while  she once more continued to read  but  alas  the story which followed  of his designs on miss darcy  received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before  and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself  from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs  and whose character she had no reason to question  at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him  but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application  and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr  darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal  if he had not been well assured of his cousin s corroboration   she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself  in their first evening at mr  phillips s  many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory  she was  now  struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger  and wondered it had escaped her before  she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done  and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct  she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr  darcy  that mr  darcy might leave the country  but that  he  should stand his ground  yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week  she remembered also that  till the netherfield family had quitted the country  he had told his story to no one but herself  but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed  that he had then no reserves  no scruples in sinking mr  darcy s character  though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son   how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned  his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary  and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes  but his eagerness to grasp at anything  his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive  he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune  or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown  every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter  and in farther justification of mr  darcy  she could not but allow that mr  bingley  when questioned by jane  had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair  that proud and repulsive as were his manners  she had never  in the whole course of their acquaintance  an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together  and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways  seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust  anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits  that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued  that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother  and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of  some  amiable feeling  that had his actions been what mr  wickham represented them  so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world  and that friendship between a person capable of it  and such an amiable man as mr  bingley  was incomprehensible   she grew absolutely ashamed of herself  of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind  partial  prejudiced  absurd    how despicably i have acted   she cried   i  who have prided myself on my discernment  i  who have valued myself on my abilities  who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister  and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust  how humiliating is this discovery  yet  how just a humiliation  had i been in love  i could not have been more wretchedly blind  but vanity  not love  has been my folly  pleased with the preference of one  and offended by the neglect of the other  on the very beginning of our acquaintance  i have courted prepossession and ignorance  and driven reason away  where either were concerned  till this moment i never knew myself    from herself to jane  from jane to bingley  her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr  darcy s explanation  there  had appeared very insufficient  and she read it again  widely different was the effect of a second perusal  how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance  which she had been obliged to give in the other  he declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister s attachment  and she could not help remembering what charlotte s opinion had always been  neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane  she felt that jane s feelings  though fervent  were little displayed  and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility   when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying  yet merited reproach  her sense of shame was severe  the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial  and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball  and as confirming all his first disapprobation  could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers   the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt  it soothed  but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been self attracted by the rest of her family  and as she considered that jane s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations  and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct  she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before   after wandering along the lane for two hours  giving way to every variety of thought  re considering events  determining probabilities  and reconciling herself  as well as she could  to a change so sudden and so important  fatigue  and a recollection of her long absence  made her at length return home  and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual  and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation   she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence  mr  darcy  only for a few minutes  to take leave  but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour  hoping for her return  and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found  elizabeth could but just  affect  concern in missing him  she really rejoiced at it  colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object  she could think only of her letter     chapter 37   the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning  and mr  collins having been in waiting near the lodges  to make them his parting obeisance  was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence  of their appearing in very good health  and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected  after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings  to rosings he then hastened  to console lady catherine and her daughter  and on his return brought back  with great satisfaction  a message from her ladyship  importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her   elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that  had she chosen it  she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece  nor could she think  without a smile  of what her ladyship s indignation would have been   what would she have said  how would she have behaved   were questions with which she amused herself   their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party   i assure you  i feel it exceedingly   said lady catherine   i believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as i do  but i am particularly attached to these young men  and know them to be so much attached to me  they were excessively sorry to go  but so they always are  the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last  but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely  more  i think  than last year  his attachment to rosings certainly increases    mr  collins had a compliment  and an allusion to throw in here  which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter   lady catherine observed  after dinner  that miss bennet seemed out of spirits  and immediately accounting for it by herself  by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon  she added    but if that is the case  you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer  mrs  collins will be very glad of your company  i am sure     i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation   replied elizabeth   but it is not in my power to accept it  i must be in town next saturday     why  at that rate  you will have been here only six weeks  i expected you to stay two months  i told mrs  collins so before you came  there can be no occasion for your going so soon  mrs  bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight     but my father cannot  he wrote last week to hurry my return     oh  your father of course may spare you  if your mother can  daughters are never of so much consequence to a father  and if you will stay another  month  complete  it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london  for i am going there early in june  for a week  and as dawson does not object to the barouche box  there will be very good room for one of you  and indeed  if the weather should happen to be cool  i should not object to taking you both  as you are neither of you large     you are all kindness  madam  but i believe we must abide by our original plan    lady catherine seemed resigned   mrs  collins  you must send a servant with them  you know i always speak my mind  and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves  it is highly improper  you must contrive to send somebody  i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing  young women should always be properly guarded and attended  according to their situation in life  when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer  i made a point of her having two men servants go with her  miss darcy  the daughter of mr  darcy  of pemberley  and lady anne  could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner  i am excessively attentive to all those things  you must send john with the young ladies  mrs  collins  i am glad it occurred to me to mention it  for it would really be discreditable to  you  to let them go alone     my uncle is to send a servant for us     oh  your uncle  he keeps a man servant  does he  i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things  where shall you change horses  oh  bromley  of course  if you mention my name at the bell  you will be attended to    lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey  and as she did not answer them all herself  attention was necessary  which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her  or  with a mind so occupied  she might have forgotten where she was  reflection must be reserved for solitary hours  whenever she was alone  she gave way to it as the greatest relief  and not a day went by without a solitary walk  in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections   mr  darcy s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart  she studied every sentence  and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different  when she remembered the style of his address  she was still full of indignation  but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him  her anger was turned against herself  and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion  his attachment excited gratitude  his general character respect  but she could not approve him  nor could she for a moment repent her refusal  or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again  in her own past behaviour  there was a constant source of vexation and regret  and in the unhappy defects of her family  a subject of yet heavier chagrin  they were hopeless of remedy  her father  contented with laughing at them  would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters  and her mother  with manners so far from right herself  was entirely insensible of the evil  elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia  but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence  what chance could there be of improvement  catherine  weak spirited  irritable  and completely under lydia s guidance  had been always affronted by their advice  and lydia  self willed and careless  would scarcely give them a hearing  they were ignorant  idle  and vain  while there was an officer in meryton  they would flirt with him  and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn  they would be going there forever   anxiety on jane s behalf was another prevailing concern  and mr  darcy s explanation  by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion  heightened the sense of what jane had lost  his affection was proved to have been sincere  and his conduct cleared of all blame  unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend  how grievous then was the thought that  of a situation so desirable in every respect  so replete with advantage  so promising for happiness  jane had been deprived  by the folly and indecorum of her own family   when to these recollections was added the development of wickham s character  it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before  were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful   their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first  the very last evening was spent there  and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey  gave them directions as to the best method of packing  and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way  that maria thought herself obliged  on her return  to undo all the work of the morning  and pack her trunk afresh   when they parted  lady catherine  with great condescension  wished them a good journey  and invited them to come to hunsford again next year  and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both     chapter 38   on saturday morning elizabeth and mr  collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared  and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary    i know not  miss elizabeth   said he   whether mrs  collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us  but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it  the favour of your company has been much felt  i assure you  we know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode  our plain manner of living  our small rooms and few domestics  and the little we see of the world  must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself  but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension  and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly    elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness  she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment  and the pleasure of being with charlotte  and the kind attentions she had received  must make  her  feel the obliged  mr  collins was gratified  and with a more smiling solemnity replied    it gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably  we have certainly done our best  and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society  and  from our connection with rosings  the frequent means of varying the humble home scene  i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome  our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast  you see on what a footing we are  you see how continually we are engaged there  in truth i must acknowledge that  with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage  i should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion  while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings    words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings  and he was obliged to walk about the room  while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences    you may  in fact  carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire  my dear cousin  i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so  lady catherine s great attentions to mrs  collins you have been a daily witness of  and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate  but on this point it will be as well to be silent  only let me assure you  my dear miss elizabeth  that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage  my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking  there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us  we seem to have been designed for each other    elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case  and with equal sincerity could add  that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts  she was not sorry  however  to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang  poor charlotte  it was melancholy to leave her to such society  but she had chosen it with her eyes open  and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go  she did not seem to ask for compassion  her home and her housekeeping  her parish and her poultry  and all their dependent concerns  had not yet lost their charms   at length the chaise arrived  the trunks were fastened on  the parcels placed within  and it was pronounced to be ready  after an affectionate parting between the friends  elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr  collins  and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family  not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter  and his compliments to mr  and mrs  gardiner  though unknown  he then handed her in  maria followed  and the door was on the point of being closed  when he suddenly reminded them  with some consternation  that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at rosings    but   he added   you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them  with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here    elizabeth made no objection  the door was then allowed to be shut  and the carriage drove off    good gracious   cried maria  after a few minutes  silence   it seems but a day or two since we first came  and yet how many things have happened     a great many indeed   said her companion with a sigh    we have dined nine times at rosings  besides drinking tea there twice  how much i shall have to tell    elizabeth added privately   and how much i shall have to conceal    their journey was performed without much conversation  or any alarm  and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr  gardiner s house  where they were to remain a few days   jane looked well  and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits  amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them  but jane was to go home with her  and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation   it was not without an effort  meanwhile  that she could wait even for longbourn  before she told her sister of mr  darcy s proposals  to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane  and must  at the same time  so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away  was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate  and her fear  if she once entered on the subject  of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister further     chapter 39   it was the second week in may  in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of       in hertfordshire  and  as they drew near the appointed inn where mr  bennet s carriage was to meet them  they quickly perceived  in token of the coachman s punctuality  both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs  these two girls had been above an hour in the place  happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner  watching the sentinel on guard  and dressing a salad and cucumber   after welcoming their sisters  they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords  exclaiming   is not this nice  is not this an agreeable surprise     and we mean to treat you all   added lydia   but you must lend us the money  for we have just spent ours at the shop out there   then  showing her purchases   look here  i have bought this bonnet  i do not think it is very pretty  but i thought i might as well buy it as not  i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home  and see if i can make it up any better    and when her sisters abused it as ugly  she added  with perfect unconcern   oh  but there were two or three much uglier in the shop  and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh  i think it will be very tolerable  besides  it will not much signify what one wears this summer  after the     shire have left meryton  and they are going in a fortnight     are they indeed   cried elizabeth  with the greatest satisfaction    they are going to be encamped near brighton  and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer  it would be such a delicious scheme  and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all  mamma would like to go too of all things  only think what a miserable summer else we shall have     yes   thought elizabeth    that  would be a delightful scheme indeed  and completely do for us at once  good heaven  brighton  and a whole campful of soldiers  to us  who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia  and the monthly balls of meryton     now i have got some news for you   said lydia  as they sat down at table   what do you think  it is excellent news  capital news  and about a certain person we all like    jane and elizabeth looked at each other  and the waiter was told he need not stay  lydia laughed  and said    aye  that is just like your formality and discretion  you thought the waiter must not hear  as if he cared  i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say  but he is an ugly fellow  i am glad he is gone  i never saw such a long chin in my life  well  but now for my news  it is about dear wickham  too good for the waiter  is it not  there is no danger of wickham s marrying mary king  there s for you  she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool  gone to stay  wickham is safe     and mary king is safe   added elizabeth   safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune     she is a great fool for going away  if she liked him     but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side   said jane    i am sure there is not on  his   i will answer for it  he never cared three straws about her  who could about such a nasty little freckled thing    elizabeth was shocked to think that  however incapable of such coarseness of  expression  herself  the coarseness of the  sentiment  was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal   as soon as all had ate  and the elder ones paid  the carriage was ordered  and after some contrivance  the whole party  with all their boxes  work bags  and parcels  and the unwelcome addition of kitty s and lydia s purchases  were seated in it    how nicely we are all crammed in   cried lydia   i am glad i bought my bonnet  if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox  well  now let us be quite comfortable and snug  and talk and laugh all the way home  and in the first place  let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away  have you seen any pleasant men  have you had any flirting  i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back  jane will be quite an old maid soon  i declare  she is almost three and twenty  lord  how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty  my aunt phillips wants you so to get husbands  you can t think  she says lizzy had better have taken mr  collins  but  i  do not think there would have been any fun in it  lord  how i should like to be married before any of you  and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls  dear me  we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster s  kitty and me were to spend the day there  and mrs  forster promised to have a little dance in the evening   by the bye  mrs  forster and me are  such  friends   and so she asked the two harringtons to come  but harriet was ill  and so pen was forced to come by herself  and then  what do you think we did  we dressed up chamberlayne in woman s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady  only think what fun  not a soul knew of it  but colonel and mrs  forster  and kitty and me  except my aunt  for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns  and you cannot imagine how well he looked  when denny  and wickham  and pratt  and two or three more of the men came in  they did not know him in the least  lord  how i laughed  and so did mrs  forster  i thought i should have died  and  that  made the men suspect something  and then they soon found out what was the matter    with such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes  did lydia  assisted by kitty s hints and additions  endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn  elizabeth listened as little as she could  but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham s name   their reception at home was most kind  mrs  bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty  and more than once during dinner did mr  bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth    i am glad you are come back  lizzy    their party in the dining room was large  for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news  and various were the subjects that occupied them  lady lucas was inquiring of maria  after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter  mrs  bennet was doubly engaged  on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane  who sat some way below her  and  on the other  retailing them all to the younger lucases  and lydia  in a voice rather louder than any other person s  was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her    oh  mary   said she   i wish you had gone with us  for we had such fun  as we went along  kitty and i drew up the blinds  and pretended there was nobody in the coach  and i should have gone so all the way  if kitty had not been sick  and when we got to the george  i do think we behaved very handsomely  for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world  and if you would have gone  we would have treated you too  and then when we came away it was such fun  i thought we never should have got into the coach  i was ready to die of laughter  and then we were so merry all the way home  we talked and laughed so loud  that anybody might have heard us ten miles off    to this mary very gravely replied   far be it from me  my dear sister  to depreciate such pleasures  they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds  but i confess they would have no charms for  me   i should infinitely prefer a book    but of this answer lydia heard not a word  she seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute  and never attended to mary at all   in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton  and to see how everybody went on  but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme  it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers  there was another reason too for her opposition  she dreaded seeing mr  wickham again  and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible  the comfort to  her  of the regiment s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression  in a fortnight they were to go  and once gone  she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account   she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme  of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn  was under frequent discussion between her parents  elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding  but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal  that her mother  though often disheartened  had never yet despaired of succeeding at last     chapter 40   elizabeth s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome  and at length  resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned  and preparing her to be surprised  she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr  darcy and herself   miss bennet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural  and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings  she was sorry that mr  darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them  but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister s refusal must have given him    his being so sure of succeeding was wrong   said she   and certainly ought not to have appeared  but consider how much it must increase his disappointment     indeed   replied elizabeth   i am heartily sorry for him  but he has other feelings  which will probably soon drive away his regard for me  you do not blame me  however  for refusing him     blame you  oh  no     but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham     no  i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did     but you  will  know it  when i tell you what happened the very next day    she then spoke of the letter  repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham  what a stroke was this for poor jane  who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind  as was here collected in one individual  nor was darcy s vindication  though grateful to her feelings  capable of consoling her for such discovery  most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error  and seek to clear the one without involving the other    this will not do   said elizabeth   you never will be able to make both of them good for anything  take your choice  but you must be satisfied with only one  there is but such a quantity of merit between them  just enough to make one good sort of man  and of late it has been shifting about pretty much  for my part  i am inclined to believe it all darcy s  but you shall do as you choose    it was some time  however  before a smile could be extorted from jane    i do not know when i have been more shocked   said she   wickham so very bad  it is almost past belief  and poor mr  darcy  dear lizzy  only consider what he must have suffered  such a disappointment  and with the knowledge of your ill opinion  too  and having to relate such a thing of his sister  it is really too distressing  i am sure you must feel it so     oh  no  my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both  i know you will do him such ample justice  that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent  your profusion makes me saving  and if you lament over him much longer  my heart will be as light as a feather     poor wickham  there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance  such an openness and gentleness in his manner     there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men  one has got all the goodness  and the other all the appearance of it     i never thought mr  darcy so deficient in the  appearance  of it as you used to do     and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him  without any reason  it is such a spur to one s genius  such an opening for wit  to have a dislike of that kind  one may be continually abusive without saying anything just  but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty     lizzy  when you first read that letter  i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now     indeed  i could not  i was uncomfortable enough  i may say unhappy  and with no one to speak to about what i felt  no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had  oh  how i wanted you     how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr  darcy  for now they  do  appear wholly undeserved     certainly  but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging  there is one point on which i want your advice  i want to be told whether i ought  or ought not  to make our acquaintances in general understand wickham s character    miss bennet paused a little  and then replied   surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully  what is your opinion     that it ought not to be attempted  mr  darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public  on the contrary  every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself  and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct  who will believe me  the general prejudice against mr  darcy is so violent  that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light  i am not equal to it  wickham will soon be gone  and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is  some time hence it will be all found out  and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before  at present i will say nothing about it     you are quite right  to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever  he is now  perhaps  sorry for what he has done  and anxious to re establish a character  we must not make him desperate    the tumult of elizabeth s mind was allayed by this conversation  she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight  and was certain of a willing listener in jane  whenever she might wish to talk again of either  but there was still something lurking behind  of which prudence forbade the disclosure  she dared not relate the other half of mr  darcy s letter  nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend  here was knowledge in which no one could partake  and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery   and then   said she   if that very improbable event should ever take place  i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself  the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value    she was now  on being settled at home  at leisure to observe the real state of her sister s spirits  jane was not happy  she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley  having never even fancied herself in love before  her regard had all the warmth of first attachment  and  from her age and disposition  greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast  and so fervently did she value his remembrance  and prefer him to every other man  that all her good sense  and all her attention to the feelings of her friends  were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity    well  lizzy   said mrs  bennet one day   what is your opinion  now  of this sad business of jane s  for my part  i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody  i told my sister phillips so the other day  but i cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london  well  he is a very undeserving young man  and i do not suppose there s the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now  there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer  and i have inquired of everybody  too  who is likely to know     i do not believe he will ever live at netherfield any more     oh well  it is just as he chooses  nobody wants him to come  though i shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill  and if i was her  i would not have put up with it  well  my comfort is  i am sure jane will die of a broken heart  and then he will be sorry for what he has done    but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation  she made no answer    well  lizzy   continued her mother  soon afterwards   and so the collinses live very comfortable  do they  well  well  i only hope it will last  and what sort of table do they keep  charlotte is an excellent manager  i dare say  if she is half as sharp as her mother  she is saving enough  there is nothing extravagant in  their  housekeeping  i dare say     no  nothing at all     a great deal of good management  depend upon it  yes  yes   they  will take care not to outrun their income   they  will never be distressed for money  well  much good may it do them  and so  i suppose  they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead  they look upon it as quite their own  i dare say  whenever that happens     it was a subject which they could not mention before me     no  it would have been strange if they had  but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves  well  if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own  so much the better  i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me      chapter 41   the first week of their return was soon gone  the second began  it was the last of the regiment s stay in meryton  and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace  the dejection was almost universal  the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat  drink  and sleep  and pursue the usual course of their employments  very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia  whose own misery was extreme  and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family    good heaven  what is to become of us  what are we to do   would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe   how can you be smiling so  lizzy    their affectionate mother shared all their grief  she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion  five and twenty years ago    i am sure   said she   i cried for two days together when colonel miller s regiment went away  i thought i should have broken my heart     i am sure i shall break  mine    said lydia    if one could but go to brighton   observed mrs  bennet    oh  yes   if one could but go to brighton  but papa is so disagreeable     a little sea bathing would set me up forever     and my aunt phillips is sure it would do  me  a great deal of good   added kitty   such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house  elizabeth tried to be diverted by them  but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame  she felt anew the justice of mr  darcy s objections  and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend   but the gloom of lydia s prospect was shortly cleared away  for she received an invitation from mrs  forster  the wife of the colonel of the regiment  to accompany her to brighton  this invaluable friend was a very young woman  and very lately married  a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other  and out of their  three  months  acquaintance they had been intimate  two    the rapture of lydia on this occasion  her adoration of mrs  forster  the delight of mrs  bennet  and the mortification of kitty  are scarcely to be described  wholly inattentive to her sister s feelings  lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy  calling for everyone s congratulations  and laughing and talking with more violence than ever  whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish    i cannot see why mrs  forster should not ask  me  as well as lydia   said she   though i am  not  her particular friend  i have just as much right to be asked as she has  and more too  for i am two years older    in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable  and jane to make her resigned  as for elizabeth herself  this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia  that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter  and detestable as such a step must make her were it known  she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go  she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia s general behaviour  the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs  forster  and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton  where the temptations must be greater than at home  he heard her attentively  and then said    lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other  and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances     if you were aware   said elizabeth   of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner  nay  which has already arisen from it  i am sure you would judge differently in the affair     already arisen   repeated mr  bennet   what  has she frightened away some of your lovers  poor little lizzy  but do not be cast down  such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret  come  let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia s folly     indeed you are mistaken  i have no such injuries to resent  it is not of particular  but of general evils  which i am now complaining  our importance  our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility  the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia s character  excuse me  for i must speak plainly  if you  my dear father  will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits  and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life  she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment  her character will be fixed  and she will  at sixteen  be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous  a flirt  too  in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation  without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person  and  from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind  wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite  in this danger kitty also is comprehended  she will follow wherever lydia leads  vain  ignorant  idle  and absolutely uncontrolled  oh  my dear father  can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known  and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace    mr  bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject  and affectionately taking her hand said in reply    do not make yourself uneasy  my love  wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued  and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of  or i may say  three  very silly sisters  we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton  let her go  then  colonel forster is a sensible man  and will keep her out of any real mischief  and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody  at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here  the officers will find women better worth their notice  let us hope  therefore  that her being there may teach her her own insignificance  at any rate  she cannot grow many degrees worse  without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life    with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content  but her own opinion continued the same  and she left him disappointed and sorry  it was not in her nature  however  to increase her vexations by dwelling on them  she was confident of having performed her duty  and to fret over unavoidable evils  or augment them by anxiety  was no part of her disposition   had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father  their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility  in lydia s imagination  a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness  she saw  with the creative eye of fancy  the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers  she saw herself the object of attention  to tens and to scores of them at present unknown  she saw all the glories of the camp  its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines  crowded with the young and the gay  and dazzling with scarlet  and  to complete the view  she saw herself seated beneath a tent  tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once   had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these  what would have been her sensations  they could have been understood only by her mother  who might have felt nearly the same  lydia s going to brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband s never intending to go there himself   but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed  and their raptures continued  with little intermission  to the very day of lydia s leaving home   elizabeth was now to see mr  wickham for the last time  having been frequently in company with him since her return  agitation was pretty well over  the agitations of former partiality entirely so  she had even learnt to detect  in the very gentleness which had first delighted her  an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary  in his present behaviour to herself  moreover  she had a fresh source of displeasure  for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve  after what had since passed  to provoke her  she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry  and while she steadily repressed it  could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing  that however long  and for whatever cause  his attentions had been withdrawn  her vanity would be gratified  and her preference secured at any time by their renewal   on the very last day of the regiment s remaining at meryton  he dined  with other of the officers  at longbourn  and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour  that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had
