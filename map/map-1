was beyond the reach of reason  and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters  in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about    it certainly is a most iniquitous affair   said mr  bennet   and nothing can clear mr  collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn  but if you will listen to his letter  you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself     no  that i am sure i shall not  and i think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all  and very hypocritical  i hate such false friends  why could he not keep on quarreling with you  as his father did before him     why  indeed  he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head  as you will hear     hunsford  near westerham  kent  15th october    dear sir      the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness  and since i have had the misfortune to lose him  i have frequently wished to heal the breach  but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts  fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance    there  mrs  bennet    my mind  however  is now made up on the subject  for having received ordination at easter  i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh  widow of sir lewis de bourgh  whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish  where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship  and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england  as a clergyman  moreover  i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence  and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable  and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side  and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch  i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters  and beg leave to apologise for it  as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends  but of this hereafter  if you should have no objection to receive me into your house  i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family  monday  november 18th  by four o clock  and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se ennight following  which i can do without any inconvenience  as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday  provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day   i remain  dear sir  with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters  your well wisher and friend    william collins    at four o clock  therefore  we may expect this peace making gentleman   said mr  bennet  as he folded up the letter   he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man  upon my word  and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance  especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again     there is some sense in what he says about the girls  however  and if he is disposed to make them any amends  i shall not be the person to discourage him     though it is difficult   said jane   to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due  the wish is certainly to his credit    elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for lady catherine  and his kind intention of christening  marrying  and burying his parishioners whenever it were required    he must be an oddity  i think   said she   i cannot make him out   there is something very pompous in his style   and what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail   we cannot suppose he would help it if he could   could he be a sensible man  sir     no  my dear  i think not  i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse  there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter  which promises well  i am impatient to see him     in point of composition   said mary   the letter does not seem defective  the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new  yet i think it is well expressed    to catherine and lydia  neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting  it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat  and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour  as for their mother  mr  collins s letter had done away much of her ill will  and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters   mr  collins was punctual to his time  and was received with great politeness by the whole family  mr  bennet indeed said little  but the ladies were ready enough to talk  and mr  collins seemed neither in need of encouragement  nor inclined to be silent himself  he was a tall  heavy looking young man of five and twenty  his air was grave and stately  and his manners were very formal  he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs  bennet on having so fine a family of daughters  said he had heard much of their beauty  but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth  and added  that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage  this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers  but mrs  bennet  who quarreled with no compliments  answered most readily    you are very kind  i am sure  and i wish with all my heart it may prove so  for else they will be destitute enough  things are settled so oddly     you allude  perhaps  to the entail of this estate     ah  sir  i do indeed  it is a grievous affair to my poor girls  you must confess  not that i mean to find fault with  you   for such things i know are all chance in this world  there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed     i am very sensible  madam  of the hardship to my fair cousins  and could say much on the subject  but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate  but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them  at present i will not say more  but  perhaps  when we are better acquainted     he was interrupted by a summons to dinner  and the girls smiled on each other  they were not the only objects of mr  collins s admiration  the hall  the dining room  and all its furniture  were examined and praised  and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs  bennet s heart  but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property  the dinner too in its turn was highly admired  and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing  but he was set right there by mrs  bennet  who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook  and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen  he begged pardon for having displeased her  in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended  but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour     chapter 14   during dinner  mr  bennet scarcely spoke at all  but when the servants were withdrawn  he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest  and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine  by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness  lady catherine de bourgh s attention to his wishes  and consideration for his comfort  appeared very remarkable  mr  bennet could not have chosen better  mr  collins was eloquent in her praise  the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner  and with a most important aspect he protested that  he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank  such affability and condescension  as he had himself experienced from lady catherine  she had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her  she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings  and had sent for him only the saturday before  to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening  lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew  but  he  had never seen anything but affability in her  she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman  she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two  to visit his relations  she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could  provided he chose with discretion  and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage  where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making  and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself  some shelves in the closet up stairs     that is all very proper and civil  i am sure   said mrs  bennet   and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman  it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her  does she live near you  sir     the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park  her ladyship s residence     i think you said she was a widow  sir  has she any family     she has only one daughter  the heiress of rosings  and of very extensive property     ah   said mrs  bennet  shaking her head   then she is better off than many girls  and what sort of young lady is she  is she handsome     she is a most charming young lady indeed  lady catherine herself says that  in point of true beauty  miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex  because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth  she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution  which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of  as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education  and who still resides with them  but she is perfectly amiable  and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies     has she been presented  i do not remember her name among the ladies at court     her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town  and by that means  as i told lady catherine one day  has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament  her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea  and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies  i have more than once observed to lady catherine  that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess  and that the most elevated rank  instead of giving her consequence  would be adorned by her  these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship  and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay     you judge very properly   said mr  bennet   and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy  may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment  or are the result of previous study     they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time  and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions  i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible    mr  bennet s expectations were fully answered  his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped  and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment  maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance  and  except in an occasional glance at elizabeth  requiring no partner in his pleasure   by tea time  however  the dose had been enough  and mr  bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again  and  when tea was over  glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies  mr  collins readily assented  and a book was produced  but  on beholding it  for everything announced it to be from a circulating library   he started back  and begging pardon  protested that he never read novels  kitty stared at him  and lydia exclaimed  other books were produced  and after some deliberation he chose fordyce s sermons  lydia gaped as he opened the volume  and before he had  with very monotonous solemnity  read three pages  she interrupted him with    do you know  mamma  that my uncle phillips talks of turning away richard  and if he does  colonel forster will hire him  my aunt told me so herself on saturday  i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it  and to ask when mr  denny comes back from town    lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue  but mr  collins  much offended  laid aside his book  and said    i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp  though written solely for their benefit  it amazes me  i confess  for  certainly  there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction  but i will no longer importune my young cousin    then turning to mr  bennet  he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon  mr  bennet accepted the challenge  observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements  mrs  bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia s interruption  and promised that it should not occur again  if he would resume his book  but mr  collins  after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will  and should never resent her behaviour as any affront  seated himself at another table with mr  bennet  and prepared for backgammon     chapter 15   mr  collins was not a sensible man  and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society  the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father  and though he belonged to one of the universities  he had merely kept the necessary terms  without forming at it any useful acquaintance  the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner  but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head  living in retirement  and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity  a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant  and the respect which he felt for her high rank  and his veneration for her as his patroness  mingling with a very good opinion of himself  of his authority as a clergyman  and his right as a rector  made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness  self importance and humility   having now a good house and a very sufficient income  he intended to marry  and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view  as he meant to choose one of the daughters  if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report  this was his plan of amends  of atonement  for inheriting their father s estate  and he thought it an excellent one  full of eligibility and suitableness  and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part   his plan did not vary on seeing them  miss bennet s lovely face confirmed his views  and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority  and for the first evening  she  was his settled choice  the next morning  however  made an alteration  for in a quarter of an hour s tete a tete with mrs  bennet before breakfast  a conversation beginning with his parsonage house  and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes  that a mistress might be found for it at longbourn  produced from her  amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement  a caution against the very jane he had fixed on   as to her  younger  daughters  she could not take upon her to say  she could not positively answer  but she did not  know  of any prepossession  her  eldest  daughter  she must just mention  she felt it incumbent on her to hint  was likely to be very soon engaged    mr  collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth  and it was soon done  done while mrs  bennet was stirring the fire  elizabeth  equally next to jane in birth and beauty  succeeded her of course   mrs  bennet treasured up the hint  and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married  and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces   lydia s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten  every sister except mary agreed to go with her  and mr  collins was to attend them  at the request of mr  bennet  who was most anxious to get rid of him  and have his library to himself  for thither mr  collins had followed him after breakfast  and there he would continue  nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection  but really talking to mr  bennet  with little cessation  of his house and garden at hunsford  such doings discomposed mr  bennet exceedingly  in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity  and though prepared  as he told elizabeth  to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house  he was used to be free from them there  his civility  therefore  was most prompt in inviting mr  collins to join his daughters in their walk  and mr  collins  being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader  was extremely pleased to close his large book  and go   in pompous nothings on his side  and civil assents on that of his cousins  their time passed till they entered meryton  the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him  their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers  and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed  or a really new muslin in a shop window  could recall them   but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man  whom they had never seen before  of most gentlemanlike appearance  walking with another officer on the other side of the way  the officer was the very mr  denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire  and he bowed as they passed  all were struck with the stranger s air  all wondered who he could be  and kitty and lydia  determined if possible to find out  led the way across the street  under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop  and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen  turning back  had reached the same spot  mr  denny addressed them directly  and entreated permission to introduce his friend  mr  wickham  who had returned with him the day before from town  and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps  this was exactly as it should be  for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming  his appearance was greatly in his favour  he had all the best part of beauty  a fine countenance  a good figure  and very pleasing address  the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation  a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming  and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably  when the sound of horses drew their notice  and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street  on distinguishing the ladies of the group  the two gentlemen came directly towards them  and began the usual civilities  bingley was the principal spokesman  and miss bennet the principal object  he was then  he said  on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her  mr  darcy corroborated it with a bow  and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth  when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger  and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other  was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting  both changed colour  one looked white  the other red  mr  wickham  after a few moments  touched his hat  a salutation which mr  darcy just deigned to return  what could be the meaning of it  it was impossible to imagine  it was impossible not to long to know   in another minute  mr  bingley  but without seeming to have noticed what passed  took leave and rode on with his friend   mr  denny and mr  wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr  phillip s house  and then made their bows  in spite of miss lydia s pressing entreaties that they should come in  and even in spite of mrs  phillips s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation   mrs  phillips was always glad to see her nieces  and the two eldest  from their recent absence  were particularly welcome  and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home  which  as their own carriage had not fetched them  she should have known nothing about  if she had not happened to see mr  jones s shop boy in the street  who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away  when her civility was claimed towards mr  collins by jane s introduction of him  she received him with her very best politeness  which he returned with as much more  apologising for his intrusion  without any previous acquaintance with her  which he could not help flattering himself  however  might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice  mrs  phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding  but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other  of whom  however  she could only tell her nieces what they already knew  that mr  denny had brought him from london  and that he was to have a lieutenant s commission in the     shire  she had been watching him the last hour  she said  as he walked up and down the street  and had mr  wickham appeared  kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation  but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers  who  in comparison with the stranger  were become  stupid  disagreeable fellows   some of them were to dine with the phillipses the next day  and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr  wickham  and give him an invitation also  if the family from longbourn would come in the evening  this was agreed to  and mrs  phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets  and a little bit of hot supper afterwards  the prospect of such delights was very cheering  and they parted in mutual good spirits  mr  collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room  and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless   as they walked home  elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen  but though jane would have defended either or both  had they appeared to be in the wrong  she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister   mr  collins on his return highly gratified mrs  bennet by admiring mrs  phillips s manners and politeness  he protested that  except lady catherine and her daughter  he had never seen a more elegant woman  for she had not only received him with the utmost civility  but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening  although utterly unknown to her before  something  he supposed  might be attributed to his connection with them  but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life     chapter 16   as no objection was made to the young people s engagement with their aunt  and all mr  collins s scruples of leaving mr  and mrs  bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted  the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton  and the girls had the pleasure of hearing  as they entered the drawing room  that mr  wickham had accepted their uncle s invitation  and was then in the house   when this information was given  and they had all taken their seats  mr  collins was at leisure to look around him and admire  and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment  that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings  a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification  but when mrs  phillips understood from him what rosings was  and who was its proprietor  when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine s drawing rooms  and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds  she felt all the force of the compliment  and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper s room   in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion  with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode  and the improvements it was receiving  he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them  and he found in mrs  phillips a very attentive listener  whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard  and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could  to the girls  who could not listen to their cousin  and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument  and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece  the interval of waiting appeared very long  it was over at last  however  the gentlemen did approach  and when mr  wickham walked into the room  elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before  nor thinking of him since  with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration  the officers of the     shire were in general a very creditable  gentlemanlike set  and the best of them were of the present party  but mr  wickham was as far beyond them all in person  countenance  air  and walk  as  they  were superior to the broad faced  stuffy uncle phillips  breathing port wine  who followed them into the room   mr  wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned  and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself  and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation  though it was only on its being a wet night  made her feel that the commonest  dullest  most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker   with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr  wickham and the officers  mr  collins seemed to sink into insignificance  to the young ladies he certainly was nothing  but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs  phillips  and was by her watchfulness  most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin  when the card tables were placed  he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn  by sitting down to whist    i know little of the game at present   said he   but i shall be glad to improve myself  for in my situation in life    mrs  phillips was very glad for his compliance  but could not wait for his reason   mr  wickham did not play at whist  and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia  at first there seemed danger of lydia s engrossing him entirely  for she was a most determined talker  but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets  she soon grew too much interested in the game  too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular  allowing for the common demands of the game  mr  wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth  and she was very willing to hear him  though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told  the history of his acquaintance with mr  darcy  she dared not even mention that gentleman  her curiosity  however  was unexpectedly relieved  mr  wickham began the subject himself  he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton  and  after receiving her answer  asked in a hesitating manner how long mr  darcy had been staying there    about a month   said elizabeth  and then  unwilling to let the subject drop  added   he is a man of very large property in derbyshire  i understand     yes   replied mr  wickham   his estate there is a noble one  a clear ten thousand per annum  you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself  for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy    elizabeth could not but look surprised    you may well be surprised  miss bennet  at such an assertion  after seeing  as you probably might  the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday  are you much acquainted with mr  darcy     as much as i ever wish to be   cried elizabeth very warmly   i have spent four days in the same house with him  and i think him very disagreeable     i have no right to give  my  opinion   said wickham   as to his being agreeable or otherwise  i am not qualified to form one  i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge  it is impossible for  me  to be impartial  but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish  and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else  here you are in your own family     upon my word  i say no more  here  than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood  except netherfield  he is not at all liked in hertfordshire  everybody is disgusted with his pride  you will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone     i cannot pretend to be sorry   said wickham  after a short interruption   that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts  but with  him  i believe it does not often happen  the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence  or frightened by his high and imposing manners  and sees him only as he chooses to be seen     i should take him  even on  my  slight acquaintance  to be an ill tempered man   wickham only shook his head    i wonder   said he  at the next opportunity of speaking   whether he is likely to be in this country much longer     i do not at all know  but i  heard  nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield  i hope your plans in favour of the     shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood     oh  no  it is not for  me  to be driven away by mr  darcy  if  he  wishes to avoid seeing  me   he must go  we are not on friendly terms  and it always gives me pain to meet him  but i have no reason for avoiding  him  but what i might proclaim before all the world  a sense of very great ill usage  and most painful regrets at his being what he is  his father  miss bennet  the late mr  darcy  was one of the best men that ever breathed  and the truest friend i ever had  and i can never be in company with this mr  darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections  his behaviour to myself has been scandalous  but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything  rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father    elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase  and listened with all her heart  but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry   mr  wickham began to speak on more general topics  meryton  the neighbourhood  the society  appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen  and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry    it was the prospect of constant society  and good society   he added   which was my chief inducement to enter the     shire  i knew it to be a most respectable  agreeable corps  and my friend denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters  and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances meryton had procured them  society  i own  is necessary to me  i have been a disappointed man  and my spirits will not bear solitude  i  must  have employment and society  a military life is not what i was intended for  but circumstances have now made it eligible  the church  ought  to have been my profession  i was brought up for the church  and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living  had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now     indeed     yes  the late mr  darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift  he was my godfather  and excessively attached to me  i cannot do justice to his kindness  he meant to provide for me amply  and thought he had done it  but when the living fell  it was given elsewhere     good heavens   cried elizabeth   but how could  that  be  how could his will be disregarded  why did you not seek legal redress     there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law  a man of honour could not have doubted the intention  but mr  darcy chose to doubt it  or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation  and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance  imprudence  in short anything or nothing  certain it is  that the living became vacant two years ago  exactly as i was of an age to hold it  and that it was given to another man  and no less certain is it  that i cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it  i have a warm  unguarded temper  and i may have spoken my opinion  of  him  and  to  him  too freely  i can recall nothing worse  but the fact is  that we are very different sort of men  and that he hates me     this is quite shocking  he deserves to be publicly disgraced     some time or other he  will  be  but it shall not be by  me   till i can forget his father  i can never defy or expose  him     elizabeth honoured him for such feelings  and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them    but what   said she  after a pause   can have been his motive  what can have induced him to behave so cruelly     a thorough  determined dislike of me  a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy  had the late mr  darcy liked me less  his son might have borne with me better  but his father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him  i believe  very early in life  he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood  the sort of preference which was often given me     i had not thought mr  darcy so bad as this  though i have never liked him  i had not thought so very ill of him  i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general  but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge  such injustice  such inhumanity as this    after a few minutes  reflection  however  she continued   i  do  remember his boasting one day  at netherfield  of the implacability of his resentments  of his having an unforgiving temper  his disposition must be dreadful     i will not trust myself on the subject   replied wickham   i can hardly be just to him    elizabeth was again deep in thought  and after a time exclaimed   to treat in such a manner the godson  the friend  the favourite of his father   she could have added   a young man  too  like  you   whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable   but she contented herself with   and one  too  who had probably been his companion from childhood  connected together  as i think you said  in the closest manner     we were born in the same parish  within the same park  the greatest part of our youth was passed together  inmates of the same house  sharing the same amusements  objects of the same parental care   my  father began life in the profession which your uncle  mr  phillips  appears to do so much credit to  but he gave up everything to be of use to the late mr  darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property  he was most highly esteemed by mr  darcy  a most intimate  confidential friend  mr  darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendence  and when  immediately before my father s death  mr  darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me  i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to  him   as of his affection to myself     how strange   cried elizabeth   how abominable  i wonder that the very pride of this mr  darcy has not made him just to you  if from no better motive  that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest  for dishonesty i must call it     it  is  wonderful   replied wickham   for almost all his actions may be traced to pride  and pride had often been his best friend  it has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling  but we are none of us consistent  and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride     can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good     yes  it has often led him to be liberal and generous  to give his money freely  to display hospitality  to assist his tenants  and relieve the poor  family pride  and  filial  pride  for he is very proud of what his father was  have done this  not to appear to disgrace his family  to degenerate from the popular qualities  or lose the influence of the pemberley house  is a powerful motive  he has also  brotherly  pride  which  with  some  brotherly affection  makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister  and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers     what sort of girl is miss darcy    he shook his head   i wish i could call her amiable  it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy  but she is too much like her brother  very  very proud  as a child  she was affectionate and pleasing  and extremely fond of me  and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement  but she is nothing to me now  she is a handsome girl  about fifteen or sixteen  and  i understand  highly accomplished  since her father s death  her home has been london  where a lady lives with her  and superintends her education    after many pauses and many trials of other subjects  elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first  and saying    i am astonished at his intimacy with mr  bingley  how can mr  bingley  who seems good humour itself  and is  i really believe  truly amiable  be in friendship with such a man  how can they suit each other  do you know mr  bingley     not at all     he is a sweet tempered  amiable  charming man  he cannot know what mr  darcy is     probably not  but mr  darcy can please where he chooses  he does not want abilities  he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while  among those who are at all his equals in consequence  he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous  his pride never deserts him  but with the rich he is liberal minded  just  sincere  rational  honourable  and perhaps agreeable  allowing something for fortune and figure    the whist party soon afterwards breaking up  the players gathered round the other table and mr  collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs  phillips  the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter  it had not been very great  he had lost every point  but when mrs  phillips began to express her concern thereupon  he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance  that he considered the money as a mere trifle  and begged that she would not make herself uneasy    i know very well  madam   said he   that when persons sit down to a card table  they must take their chances of these things  and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object  there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same  but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh  i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters    mr  wickham s attention was caught  and after observing mr  collins for a few moments  he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh    lady catherine de bourgh   she replied   has very lately given him a living  i hardly know how mr  collins was first introduced to her notice  but he certainly has not known her long     you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters  consequently that she is aunt to the present mr  darcy     no  indeed  i did not  i knew nothing at all of lady catherine s connections  i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday     her daughter  miss de bourgh  will have a very large fortune  and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates    this information made elizabeth smile  as she thought of poor miss bingley  vain indeed must be all her attentions  vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself  if he were already self destined for another    mr  collins   said she   speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter  but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship  i suspect his gratitude misleads him  and that in spite of her being his patroness  she is an arrogant  conceited woman     i believe her to be both in a great degree   replied wickham   i have not seen her for many years  but i very well remember that i never liked her  and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent  she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever  but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune  part from her authoritative manner  and the rest from the pride for her nephew  who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class    elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it  and they continued talking together  with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards  and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr  wickham s attentions  there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs  phillips s supper party  but his manners recommended him to everybody  whatever he said  was said well  and whatever he did  done gracefully  elizabeth went away with her head full of him  she could think of nothing but of mr  wickham  and of what he had told her  all the way home  but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went  for neither lydia nor mr  collins were once silent  lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets  of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won  and mr  collins in describing the civility of mr  and mrs  phillips  protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist  enumerating all the dishes at supper  and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins  had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house     chapter 17   elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr  wickham and herself  jane listened with astonishment and concern  she knew not how to believe that mr  darcy could be so unworthy of mr  bingley s regard  and yet  it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham  the possibility of his having endured such unkindness  was enough to interest all her tender feelings  and nothing remained therefore to be done  but to think well of them both  to defend the conduct of each  and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained    they have both   said she   been deceived  i dare say  in some way or other  of which we can form no idea  interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other  it is  in short  impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them  without actual blame on either side     very true  indeed  and now  my dear jane  what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business  do clear  them  too  or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody     laugh as much as you choose  but you will not laugh me out of my opinion  my dearest lizzy  do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr  darcy  to be treating his father s favourite in such a manner  one whom his father had promised to provide for  it is impossible  no man of common humanity  no man who had any value for his character  could be capable of it  can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him  oh  no     i can much more easily believe mr  bingley s being imposed on  than that mr  wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night  names  facts  everything mentioned without ceremony  if it be not so  let mr  darcy contradict it  besides  there was truth in his looks     it is difficult indeed  it is distressing  one does not know what to think     i beg your pardon  one knows exactly what to think    but jane could think with certainty on only one point  that mr  bingley  if he  had  been imposed on  would have much to suffer when the affair became public   the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery  where this conversation passed  by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking  mr  bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield  which was fixed for the following tuesday  the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again  called it an age since they had met  and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation  to the rest of the family they paid little attention  avoiding mrs  bennet as much as possible  saying not much to elizabeth  and nothing at all to the others  they were soon gone again  rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise  and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs  bennet s civilities   the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family  mrs  bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter  and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr  bingley himself  instead of a ceremonious card  jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends  and the attentions of their brother  and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr  wickham  and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr  darcy s look and behaviour  the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event  or any particular person  for though they each  like elizabeth  meant to dance half the evening with mr  wickham  he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them  and a ball was  at any rate  a ball  and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it    while i can have my mornings to myself   said she   it is enough  i think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements  society has claims on us all  and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody    elizabeth s spirits were so high on this occasion  that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr  collins  she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr  bingley s invitation  and if he did  whether he would think it proper to join in the evening s amusement  and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head  and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop  or lady catherine de bourgh  by venturing to dance    i am by no means of the opinion  i assure you   said he   that a ball of this kind  given by a young man of character  to respectable people  can have any evil tendency  and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself  that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening  and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours  miss elizabeth  for the two first dances especially  a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause  and not to any disrespect for her    elizabeth felt herself completely taken in  she had fully proposed being engaged by mr  wickham for those very dances  and to have mr  collins instead  her liveliness had never been worse timed  there was no help for it  however  mr  wickham s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer  and mr  collins s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could  she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more  it now first struck her  that  she  was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of hunsford parsonage  and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings  in the absence of more eligible visitors  the idea soon reached to conviction  as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself  and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity  and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms  it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to  her   elizabeth  however  did not choose to take the hint  being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply  mr  collins might never make the offer  and till he did  it was useless to quarrel about him   if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of  the younger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time  for from the day of the invitation  to the day of the ball  there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once  no aunt  no officers  no news could be sought after  the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy  even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr  wickham  and nothing less than a dance on tuesday  could have made such a friday  saturday  sunday  and monday endurable to kitty and lydia     chapter 18   till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield  and looked in vain for mr  wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled  a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her  the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her  she had dressed with more than usual care  and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart  trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening  but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr  darcy s pleasure in the bingleys  invitation to the officers  and though this was not exactly the case  the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend denny  to whom lydia eagerly applied  and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before  and was not yet returned  adding  with a significant smile   i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now  if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here    this part of his intelligence  though unheard by lydia  was caught by elizabeth  and  as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham s absence than if her first surmise had been just  every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment  that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make  attendance  forbearance  patience with darcy  was injury to wickham  she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him  and turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr  bingley  whose blind partiality provoked her   but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour  and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening  it could not dwell long on her spirits  and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas  whom she had not seen for a week  she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin  and to point him out to her particular notice  the first two dances  however  brought a return of distress  they were dances of mortification  mr  collins  awkward and solemn  apologising instead of attending  and often moving wrong without being aware of it  gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give  the moment of her release from him was ecstasy   she danced next with an officer  and had the refreshment of talking of wickham  and of hearing that he was universally liked  when those dances were over  she returned to charlotte lucas  and was in conversation with her  when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr  darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand  that  without knowing what she did  she accepted him  he walked away again immediately  and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind  charlotte tried to console her    i dare say you will find him very agreeable     heaven forbid   that  would be the greatest misfortune of all  to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate  do not wish me such an evil    when the dancing recommenced  however  and darcy approached to claim her hand  charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper  not to be a simpleton  and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence  elizabeth made no answer  and took her place in the set  amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr  darcy  and reading in her neighbours  looks  their equal amazement in beholding it  they stood for some time without speaking a word  and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances  and at first was resolved not to break it  till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk  she made some slight observation on the dance  he replied  and was again silent  after a pause of some minutes  she addressed him a second time with    it is  your  turn to say something now  mr  darcy  i talked about the dance  and  you  ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room  or the number of couples    he smiled  and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said    very well  that reply will do for the present  perhaps by and by i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones  but  now  we may be silent     do you talk by rule  then  while you are dancing     sometimes  one must speak a little  you know  it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together  and yet for the advantage of  some   conversation ought to be so arranged  as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible     are you consulting your own feelings in the present case  or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine     both   replied elizabeth archly   for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds  we are each of an unsocial  taciturn disposition  unwilling to speak  unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room  and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb     this is no very striking resemblance of your own character  i am sure   said he   how near it may be to  mine   i cannot pretend to say   you  think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly     i must not decide on my own performance    he made no answer  and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance  when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton  she answered in the affirmative  and  unable to resist the temptation  added   when you met us there the other day  we had just been forming a new acquaintance    the effect was immediate  a deeper shade of  hauteur  overspread his features  but he said not a word  and elizabeth  though blaming herself for her own weakness  could not go on  at length darcy spoke  and in a constrained manner said   mr  wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his  making  friends  whether he may be equally capable of  retaining  them  is less certain     he has been so unlucky as to lose  your  friendship   replied elizabeth with emphasis   and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life    darcy made no answer  and seemed desirous of changing the subject  at that moment  sir william lucas appeared close to them  meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room  but on perceiving mr  darcy  he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner    i have been most highly gratified indeed  my dear sir  such very superior dancing is not often seen  it is evident that you belong to the first circles  allow me to say  however  that your fair partner does not disgrace you  and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated  especially when a certain desirable event  my dear eliza  glancing at her sister and bingley  shall take place  what congratulations will then flow in  i appeal to mr  darcy   but let me not interrupt you  sir  you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady  whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me    the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy  but sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly  and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane  who were dancing together  recovering himself  however  shortly  he turned to his partner  and said   sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of     i do not think we were speaking at all  sir william could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves  we have tried two or three subjects already without success  and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine     what think you of books   said he  smiling    books  oh  no  i am sure we never read the same  or not with the same feelings     i am sorry you think so  but if that be the case  there can at least be no want of subject  we may compare our different opinions     no  i cannot talk of books in a ball room  my head is always full of something else     the  present  always occupies you in such scenes  does it   said he  with a look of doubt    yes  always   she replied  without knowing what she said  for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject  as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming   i remember hearing you once say  mr  darcy  that you hardly ever forgave  that your resentment once created was unappeasable  you are very cautious  i suppose  as to its  being created      i am   said he  with a firm voice    and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice     i hope not     it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion  to be secure of judging properly at first     may i ask to what these questions tend     merely to the illustration of  your  character   said she  endeavouring to shake off her gravity   i am trying to make it out     and what is your success    she shook her head   i do not get on at all  i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly     i can readily believe   answered he gravely   that reports may vary greatly with respect to me  and i could wish  miss bennet  that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment  as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either     but if i do not take your likeness now  i may never have another opportunity     i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours   he coldly replied  she said no more  and they went down the other dance and parted in silence  and on each side dissatisfied  though not to an equal degree  for in darcy s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her  which soon procured her pardon  and directed all his anger against another   they had not long separated  when miss bingley came towards her  and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her    so  miss eliza  i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham  your sister has been talking to me about him  and asking me a thousand questions  and i find that the young man quite forgot to tell you  among his other communication  that he was the son of old wickham  the late mr  darcy s steward  let me recommend you  however  as a friend  not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions  for as to mr  darcy s using him ill  it is perfectly false  for  on the contrary  he has always been remarkably kind to him  though george wickham has treated mr  darcy in a most infamous manner  i do not know the particulars  but i know very well that mr  darcy is not in the least to blame  that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned  and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers  he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way  his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing  indeed  and i wonder how he could presume to do it  i pity you  miss eliza  for this discovery of your favourite s guilt  but really  considering his descent  one could not expect much better     his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same   said elizabeth angrily   for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr  darcy s steward  and of  that   i can assure you  he informed me himself     i beg your pardon   replied miss bingley  turning away with a sneer   excuse my interference  it was kindly meant     insolent girl   said elizabeth to herself   you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this  i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr  darcy   she then sought her eldest sister  who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley  jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency  a glow of such happy expression  as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening  elizabeth instantly read her feelings  and at that moment solicitude for wickham  resentment against his enemies  and everything else  gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness    i want to know   said she  with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s   what you have learnt about mr  wickham  but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person  in which case you may be sure of my pardon     no   replied jane   i have not forgotten him  but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you  mr  bingley does not know the whole of his history  and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr  darcy  but he will vouch for the good conduct  the probity  and honour of his friend  and is perfectly convinced that mr  wickham has deserved much less attention from mr  darcy than he has received  and i am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister s  mr  wickham is by no means a respectable young man  i am afraid he has been very imprudent  and has deserved to lose mr  darcy s regard     mr  bingley does not know mr  wickham himself     no  he never saw him till the other morning at meryton     this account then is what he has received from mr  darcy  i am satisfied  but what does he say of the living     he does not exactly recollect the circumstances  though he has heard them from mr  darcy more than once  but he believes that it was left to him  conditionally  only     i have not a doubt of mr  bingley s sincerity   said elizabeth warmly   but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only  mr  bingley s defense of his friend was a very able one  i dare say  but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story  and has learnt the rest from that friend himself  i shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as i did before    she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each  and on which there could be no difference of sentiment  elizabeth listened with delight to the happy  though modest hopes which jane entertained of mr  bingley s regard  and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it  on their being joined by mr  bingley himself  elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas  to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied  before mr  collins came up to them  and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery    i have found out   said he   by a singular accident  that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness  i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh  and of her mother lady catherine  how wonderfully these sort of things occur  who would have thought of my meeting with  perhaps  a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly  i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him  which i am now going to do  and trust he will excuse my not having done it before  my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology     you are not going to introduce yourself to mr  darcy     indeed i am  i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier  i believe him to be lady catherine s  nephew   it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se nnight    elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme  assuring him that mr  darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom  rather than a compliment to his aunt  that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side  and that if it were  it must belong to mr  darcy  the superior in consequence  to begin the acquaintance  mr  collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination  and  when she ceased speaking  replied thus    my dear miss elizabeth  i have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding  but permit me to say  that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity  and those which regulate the clergy  for  give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom  provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained  you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion  which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty  pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice  which on every other subject shall be my constant guide  though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself   and with a low bow he left her to attack mr  darcy  whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched  and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident  her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it  she felt as if hearing it all  and saw in the motion of his lips the words  apology    hunsford   and  lady catherine de bourgh   it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man  mr  darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder  and when at last mr  collins allowed him time to speak  replied with an air of distant civility  mr  collins  however  was not discouraged from speaking again  and mr  darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech  and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow  and moved another way  mr  collins then returned to elizabeth    i have no reason  i assure you   said he   to be dissatisfied with my reception  mr  darcy seemed much pleased with the attention  he answered me with the utmost civility  and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily  it was really a very handsome thought  upon the whole  i am much pleased with him    as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue  she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr  bingley  and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to  made her perhaps almost as happy as jane  she saw her in idea settled in that very house  in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow  and she felt capable  under such circumstances  of endeavouring even to like bingley s two sisters  her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way  and she determined not to venture near her  lest she might hear too much  when they sat down to supper  therefore  she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other  and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person  lady lucas  freely  openly  and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soon be married to mr  bingley  it was an animating subject  and mrs  bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match  his being such a charming young man  and so rich  and living but three miles from them  were the first points of self gratulation  and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane  and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do  it was  moreover  such a promising thing for her younger daughters  as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men  and lastly  it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister  that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked  it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure  because on such occasions it is the etiquette  but no one was less likely than mrs  bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life  she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate  though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it   in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words  or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper  for  to her inexpressible vexation  she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr  darcy  who sat opposite to them  her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical    what is mr  darcy to me  pray  that i should be afraid of him  i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing  he  may not like to hear     for heaven s sake  madam  speak lower  what advantage can it be for you to offend mr  darcy  you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing    nothing that she could say  however  had any influence  her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone  elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation  she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr  darcy  though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded  for though he was not always looking at her mother  she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her  the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity   at length  however  mrs  bennet had no more to say  and lady lucas  who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing  was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken  elizabeth now began to revive  but not long was the interval of tranquillity  for  when supper was over  singing was talked of  and she had the mortification of seeing mary  after very little entreaty  preparing to oblige the company  by many significant looks and silent entreaties  did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance  but in vain  mary would not understand them  such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her  and she began her song  elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations  and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close  for mary  on receiving  amongst the thanks of the table  the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again  after the pause of half a minute began another  mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display  her voice was weak  and her manner affected  elizabeth was in agonies  she looked at jane  to see how she bore it  but jane was very composedly talking to bingley  she looked at his two sisters  and saw them making signs of derision at each other  and at darcy  who continued  however  imperturbably grave  she looked at her father to entreat his interference  lest mary should be singing all night  he took the hint  and when mary had finished her second song  said aloud   that will do extremely well  child  you have delighted us long enough  let the other young ladies have time to exhibit    mary  though pretending not to hear  was somewhat disconcerted  and elizabeth  sorry for her  and sorry for her father s speech  was afraid her anxiety had done no good  others of the party were now applied to    if i   said mr  collins   were so fortunate as to be able to sing  i should have great pleasure  i am sure  in obliging the company with an air  for i consider music as a very innocent diversion  and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman  i do not mean  however  to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music  for there are certainly other things to be attended to  the rector of a parish has much to do  in the first place  he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron  he must write his own sermons  and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties  and the care and improvement of his dwelling  which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible  and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody  especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment  i cannot acquit him of that duty  nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family   and with a bow to mr  darcy  he concluded his speech  which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room  many stared  many smiled  but no one looked more amused than mr  bennet himself  while his wife seriously commended mr  collins for having spoken so sensibly  and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas  that he was a remarkably clever  good kind of young man   to elizabeth it appeared that  had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening  it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success  and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice  and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed  that his two sisters and mr  darcy  however  should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations  was bad enough  and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman  or the insolent smiles of the ladies  were more intolerable   the rest of the evening brought her little amusement  she was teased by mr  collins  who continued most perseveringly by her side  and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again  put it out of her power to dance with others  in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else  and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room  he assured her  that as to dancing  he was perfectly indifferent to it  that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening  there was no arguing upon such a project  she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas  who often joined them  and good naturedly engaged mr  collins s conversation to herself   she was at least free from the offense of mr  darcy s further notice  though often standing within a very short distance of her  quite disengaged  he never came near enough to speak  she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr  wickham  and rejoiced in it   the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart  and  by a manoeuvre of mrs  bennet  had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone  which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family  mrs  hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths  except to complain of fatigue  and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves  they repulsed every attempt of mrs  bennet at conversation  and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party  which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr  collins  who was complimenting mr  bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment  and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests  darcy said nothing at all  mr  bennet  in equal silence  was enjoying the scene  mr  bingley and jane were standing together  a little detached from the rest  and talked only to each other  elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs  hurst or miss bingley  and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of  lord  how tired i am   accompanied by a violent yawn   when at length they arose to take leave  mrs  bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn  and addressed herself especially to mr  bingley  to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time  without the ceremony of a formal invitation  bingley was all grateful pleasure  and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her  after his return from london  whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time   mrs  bennet was perfectly satisfied  and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that  allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements  new carriages  and wedding clothes  she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months  of having another daughter married to mr  collins  she thought with equal certainty  and with considerable  though not equal  pleasure  elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children  and though the man and the match were quite good enough for  her   the worth of each was eclipsed by mr  bingley and netherfield     chapter 19   the next day opened a new scene at longbourn  mr  collins made his declaration in form  having resolved to do it without loss of time  as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday  and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment  he set about it in a very orderly manner  with all the observances  which he supposed a regular part of the business  on finding mrs  bennet  elizabeth  and one of the younger girls together  soon after breakfast  he addressed the mother in these words    may i hope  madam  for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth  when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning    before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise  mrs  bennet answered instantly   oh dear   yes  certainly  i am sure lizzy will be very happy  i am sure she can have no objection  come  kitty  i want you up stairs   and  gathering her work together  she was hastening away  when elizabeth called out    dear madam  do not go  i beg you will not go  mr  collins must excuse me  he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear  i am going away myself     no  no  nonsense  lizzy  i desire you to stay where you are   and upon elizabeth s seeming really  with vexed and embarrassed looks  about to escape  she added   lizzy  i  insist  upon your staying and hearing mr  collins    elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction  and a moment s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible  she sat down again and tried to conceal  by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion  mrs  bennet and kitty walked off  and as soon as they were gone  mr  collins began    believe me  my dear miss elizabeth  that your modesty  so far from doing you any disservice  rather adds to your other perfections  you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there  not  been this little unwillingness  but allow me to assure you  that i have your respected mother s permission for this address  you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse  however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble  my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken  almost as soon as i entered the house  i singled you out as the companion of my future life  but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject  perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying  and  moreover  for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife  as i certainly did    the idea of mr  collins  with all his solemn composure  being run away with by his feelings  made elizabeth so near laughing  that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further  and he continued    my reasons for marrying are  first  that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances  like myself  to set the example of matrimony in his parish  secondly  that i am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness  and thirdly  which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier  that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness  twice has she condescended to give me her opinion  unasked too   on this subject  and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford  between our pools at quadrille  while mrs  jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s footstool  that she said   mr  collins  you must marry  a clergyman like you must marry  choose properly  choose a gentlewoman for  my  sake  and for your  own   let her be an active  useful sort of person  not brought up high  but able to make a small income go a good way  this is my advice  find such a woman as soon as you can  bring her to hunsford  and i will visit her   allow me  by the way  to observe  my fair cousin  that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer  you will find her manners beyond anything i can describe  and your wit and vivacity  i think  must be acceptable to her  especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite  thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony  it remains to be told why my views were directed towards longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood  where i can assure you there are many amiable young women  but the fact is  that being  as i am  to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father  who  however  may live many years longer   i could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters  that the loss to them might be as little as possible  when the melancholy event takes place  which  however  as i have already said  may not be for several years  this has been my motive  my fair cousin  and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem  and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection  to fortune i am perfectly indifferent  and shall make no demand of that nature on your father  since i am well aware that it could not be complied with  and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents  which will not be yours till after your mother s decease  is all that you may ever be entitled to  on that head  therefore  i shall be uniformly silent  and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married    it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now    you are too hasty  sir   she cried   you forget that i have made no answer  let me do it without further loss of time  accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me  i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals  but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them     i am not now to learn   replied mr  collins  with a formal wave of the hand   that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept  when he first applies for their favour  and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second  or even a third time  i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said  and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long     upon my word  sir   cried elizabeth   your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration  i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies  if such young ladies there are  who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time  i am perfectly serious in my refusal  you could not make  me  happy  and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who could make you so  nay  were your friend lady catherine to know me  i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation     were it certain that lady catherine would think so   said mr  collins very gravely   but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you  and you may be certain when i have the honour of seeing her again  i shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty  economy  and other amiable qualification     indeed  mr  collins  all praise of me will be unnecessary  you must give me leave to judge for myself  and pay me the compliment of believing what i say  i wish you very happy and very rich  and by refusing your hand  do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise  in making me the offer  you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family  and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls  without any self reproach  this matter may be considered  therefore  as finally settled   and rising as she thus spoke  she would have quitted the room  had mr  collins not thus addressed her    when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject  i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me  though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present  because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application  and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character     really  mr  collins   cried elizabeth with some warmth   you puzzle me exceedingly  if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement  i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one     you must give me leave to flatter myself  my dear cousin  that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course  my reasons for believing it are briefly these  it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance  or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable  my situation in life  my connections with the family of de bourgh  and my relationship to your own  are circumstances highly in my favour  and you should take it into further consideration  that in spite of your manifold attractions  it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you  your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications  as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me  i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense  according to the usual practice of elegant females     i do assure you  sir  that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man  i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere  i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals  but to accept them is absolutely impossible  my feelings in every respect forbid it  can i speak plainer  do not consider me now as an elegant female  intending to plague you  but as a rational creature  speaking the truth from her heart     you are uniformly charming   cried he  with an air of awkward gallantry   and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents  my proposals will not fail of being acceptable    to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply  and immediately and in silence withdrew  determined  if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement  to apply to her father  whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive  and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female     chapter 20   mr  collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love  for mrs  bennet  having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference  no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase  than she entered the breakfast room  and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection  mr  collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure  and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview  with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied  since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character   this information  however  startled mrs  bennet  she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals  but she dared not believe it  and could not help saying so    but  depend upon it  mr  collins   she added   that lizzy shall be brought to reason  i will speak to her about it directly  she is a very headstrong  foolish girl  and does not know her own interest but i will  make  her know it     pardon me for interrupting you  madam   cried mr  collins   but if she is really headstrong and foolish  i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation  who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state  if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit  perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me  because if liable to such defects of temper  she could not contribute much to my felicity     sir  you quite misunderstand me   said mrs  bennet  alarmed   lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these  in everything else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived  i will go directly to mr  bennet  and we shall very soon settle it with her  i am sure    she would not give him time to reply  but hurrying instantly to her husband  called out as she entered the library   oh  mr  bennet  you are wanted immediately  we are all in an uproar  you must come and make lizzy marry mr  collins  for she vows she will not have him  and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have  her     mr  bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered  and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication    i have not the pleasure of understanding you   said he  when she had finished her speech   of what are you talking     of mr  collins and lizzy  lizzy declares she will not have mr  collins  and mr  collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy     and what am i to do on the occasion  it seems an hopeless business     speak to lizzy about it yourself  tell her that you insist upon her marrying him     let her be called down  she shall hear my opinion    mrs  bennet rang the bell  and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library    come here  child   cried her father as she appeared   i have sent for you on an affair of importance  i understand that mr  collins has made you an offer of marriage  is it true   elizabeth replied that it was   very well  and this offer of marriage you have refused     i have  sir     very well  we now come to the point  your mother insists upon your accepting it  is it not so  mrs  bennet     yes  or i will never see her again     an unhappy alternative is before you  elizabeth  from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents  your mother will never see you again if you do  not  marry mr  collins  and i will never see you again if you  do     elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning  but mrs  bennet  who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished  was excessively disappointed    what do you mean  mr  bennet  in talking this way  you promised me to  insist  upon her marrying him     my dear   replied her husband   i have two small favours to request  first  that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion  and secondly  of my room  i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be    not yet  however  in spite of her disappointment in her husband  did mrs  bennet give up the point  she talked to elizabeth again and again  coaxed and threatened her by turns  she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest  but jane  with all possible mildness  declined interfering  and elizabeth  sometimes with real earnestness  and sometimes with playful gaiety  replied to her attacks  though her manner varied  however  her determination never did   mr  collins  meanwhile  was meditating in solitude on what had passed  he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him  and though his pride was hurt  he suffered in no other way  his regard for her was quite imaginary  and the possibility of her deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret   while the family were in this confusion  charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them  she was met in the vestibule by lydia  who  flying to her  cried in a half whisper   i am glad you are come  for there is such fun here  what do you think has happened this morning  mr  collins has made an offer to lizzy  and she will not have him    charlotte hardly had time to answer  before they were joined by kitty  who came to tell the same news  and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room  where mrs  bennet was alone  than she likewise began on the subject  calling on miss lucas for her compassion  and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family   pray do  my dear miss lucas   she added in a melancholy tone   for nobody is on my side  nobody takes part with me  i am cruelly used  nobody feels for my poor nerves    charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth    aye  there she comes   continued mrs  bennet   looking as unconcerned as may be  and caring no more for us than if we were at york  provided she can have her own way  but i tell you  miss lizzy  if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way  you will never get a husband at all  and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead  i shall not be able to keep you  and so i warn you  i have done with you from this very day  i told you in the library  you know  that i should never speak to you again  and you will find me as good as my word  i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children  not that i have much pleasure  indeed  in talking to anybody  people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking  nobody can tell what i suffer  but it is always so  those who do not complain are never pitied    her daughters listened in silence to this effusion  sensible that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the irritation  she talked on  therefore  without interruption from any of them  till they were joined by mr  collins  who entered the room with an air more stately than usual  and on perceiving whom  she said to the girls   now  i do insist upon it  that you  all of you  hold your tongues  and let me and mr  collins have a little conversation together    elizabeth passed quietly out of the room  jane and kitty followed  but lydia stood her ground  determined to hear all she could  and charlotte  detained first by the civility of mr  collins  whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute  and then by a little curiosity  satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear  in a doleful voice mrs  bennet began the projected conversation   oh  mr  collins     my dear madam   replied he   let us be for ever silent on this point  far be it from me   he presently continued  in a voice that marked his displeasure   to resent the behaviour of your daughter  resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all  the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment  and i trust i am resigned  perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand  for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation  you will not  i hope  consider me as showing any disrespect to your family  my dear madam  by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour  without having paid yourself and mr  bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf  my conduct may  i fear  be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own  but we are all liable to error  i have certainly meant well through the whole affair  my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself  with due consideration for the advantage of all your family  and if my  manner  has been at all reprehensible  i here beg leave to apologise      chapter 21   the discussion of mr  collins s offer was now nearly at an end  and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it  and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother  as for the gentleman himself   his  feelings were chiefly expressed  not by embarrassment or dejection  or by trying to avoid her  but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence  he scarcely ever spoke to her  and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas  whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all  and especially to her friend   the morrow produced no abatement of mrs  bennet s ill humour or ill health  mr  collins was also in the same state of angry pride  elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit  but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it  he was always to have gone on saturday  and to saturday he meant to stay   after breakfast  the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr  wickham were returned  and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball  he joined them on their entering the town  and attended them to their aunt s where his regret and vexation  and the concern of everybody  was well talked over  to elizabeth  however  he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence  had  been self imposed    i found   said he   as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr  darcy  that to be in the same room  the same party with him for so many hours together  might be more than i could bear  and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself    she highly approved his forbearance  and they had leisure for a full discussion of it  and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other  as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn  and during the walk he particularly attended to her  his accompanying them was a double advantage  she felt all the compliment it offered to herself  and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother   soon after their return  a letter was delivered to miss bennet  it came from netherfield  the envelope contained a sheet of elegant  little  hot pressed paper  well covered with a lady s fair  flowing hand  and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance change as she read it  and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages  jane recollected herself soon  and putting the letter away  tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation  but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham  and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave  than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs  when they had gained their own room  jane  taking out the letter  said    this is from caroline bingley  what it contains has surprised me a good deal  the whole party have left netherfield by this time  and are on their way to town  and without any intention of coming back again  you shall hear what she says    she then read the first sentence aloud  which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly  and of their meaning to dine in grosvenor street  where mr  hurst had a house  the next was in these words   i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire  except your society  my
