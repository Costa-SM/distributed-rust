no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner  i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required  we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together  if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes  in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ankles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise  she was shown into the breakfastparlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it she was received however very politely by them and in their brothers manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness mr darcy said very little and mr hurst nothing at all the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone the latter was thinking only of his breakfast  her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with elizabeth silently attended her  when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for jane the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere  when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes    chapter 8   at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at halfpast six elizabeth was summoned to dinner to the civil inquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingleys she could not make a very favourable answer jane was by no means better the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike  their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others she had very little notice from any but him miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her  when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no beauty mrs hurst thought the same and added  she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker i shall never forget her appearance this morning she really looked almost wild  she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very nonsensical to come at all! why must _she_ be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold? her hair so untidy so blowsy!  yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office  your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice  _you_ observed it mr darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such an exhibition  certainly not  to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ankles in dirt and alone quite alone! what could she mean by it? it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence a most countrytown indifference to decorum  it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley  i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes  not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise a short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again  i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it  i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton  yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside  that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily  if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable  but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy  to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations  with a renewal of tenderness however they returned to her room on leaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself on entering the drawingroom she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book mr hurst looked at her with astonishment  do you prefer reading to cards? said he that is rather singular  miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else  i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am _not_ a great reader and i have pleasure in many things  in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well  elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying he immediately offered to fetch her othersall that his library afforded  and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever looked into  elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room  i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr darcy!  it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations  and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books  i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these  neglect! i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place charles when you build _your_ house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley  i wish it may  but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire  with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it  i am talking of possibilities charles  upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation  elizabeth was so much caught with what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the cardtable and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game  is miss darcy much grown since the spring? said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am?  i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or rather taller  how i long to see her again! i never met with anybody who delighted me so much such a countenance such manners! and so extremely accomplished for her age! her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite  it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are  all young ladies accomplished! my dear charles what do you mean?  yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover screens and net purses i scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished  your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i cannot boast of knowing more than halfadozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished  nor i i am sure said miss bingley  then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman  yes i do comprehend a great deal in it  oh! certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but halfdeserved  all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading  i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_  are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?  i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united  mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room  elizabeth bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art  undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable  miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject  elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her bingley urged mr jones being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister    chapter 9   elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgement of her situation the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with mrs bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast  had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield she would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour bingley met them with hopes that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected  indeed i have sir was her answer she is a great deal too ill to be moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass a little longer on your kindness  removed! cried bingley it must not be thought of my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal  you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us  mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments  i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i have ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_ you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over the gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease  whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here  that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth  you begin to comprehend me do you? cried he turning towards her  oh! yesi understand you perfectly  i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful  that is as it happens it does not follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours  lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home  i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character it must be an amusing study  yes but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing they have at least that advantage  the country said darcy can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society  but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever  yes indeed cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood i assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town  everybody was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away mrs bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph  i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal pleasanter is it not mr bingley?  when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either  ayethat is because you have the right disposition but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all  indeed mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town which you must acknowledge to be true  certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger i know we dine with fourandtwenty families  nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance his sister was less delicate and directed her eyes towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away  yes she called yesterday with her father what an agreeable man sir william is mr bingley is not he? so much the man of fashion! so genteel and easy! he has always something to say to everybody _that_ is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter  did charlotte dine with you?  no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mincepies for my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work _my_ daughters are brought up very differently but everybody is to judge for themselves and the lucases are a very good sort of girls i assure you it is a pity they are not handsome! not that i think charlotte so _very_ plainbut then she is our particular friend  she seems a very pleasant young woman  oh! dear yes but you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me janes beauty i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure janeone does not often see anybody better looking it is what everybody says i do not trust my own partiality when she was only fifteen there was a man at my brother gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away but however he did not perhaps he thought her too young however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were  and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!  i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love said darcy  of a fine stout healthy love it may everything nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away  darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mrs bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield  lydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and goodhumoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which the attention of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear  i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball but you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill  lydia declared herself satisfied oh! yesit would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again and when you have given _your_ ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not  mrs bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_ in spite of all miss bingleys witticisms on _fine eyes_    chapter 10   the day passed much as the day before had done mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawingroom the lootable however did not appear mr darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet and mrs hurst was observing their game  elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in union with her opinion of each  how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter!  he made no answer  you write uncommonly fast  you are mistaken i write rather slowly  how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year! letters of business too! how odious i should think them!  it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of yours  pray tell your sister that i long to see her  i have already told her so once by your desire  i am afraid you do not like your pen let me mend it for you i mend pens remarkably well  thank youbut i always mend my own  how can you contrive to write so even?  he was silent  tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantleys  will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again? at present i have not room to do them justice  oh! it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy?  they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine  it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill  that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does _not_ write with ease he studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcy?  my style of writing is very different from yours  oh! cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the rest  my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express themby which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents  your humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof  nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast  and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?  the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting the power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?  nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i believe what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies  i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not goand at another word might stay a month  you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shown him off now much more than he did himself  i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could  would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?  upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself  you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety  to yield readilyeasilyto the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you  to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either  you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it?  will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?  by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do  mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense  i see your design bingley said his friend you dislike an argument and want to silence this  perhaps i do arguments are too much like disputes if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me  what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr darcy had much better finish his letter  mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter  when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for an indulgence of some music miss bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself  mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some musicbooks that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcys eyes were fixed on her she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present the supposition did not pain her she liked him too little to care for his approbation  after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her  do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?  she smiled but made no answer he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence  oh! said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at alland now despise me if you dare  indeed i do not dare  elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger  miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth  she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance  i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after officers and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses  have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?  oh! yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt phillips be placed in the gallery at pemberley put them next to your greatuncle the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different lines as for your elizabeths picture you must not have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?  it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be copied  at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself  i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard  you used us abominably ill answered mrs hurst running away without telling us that you were coming out  then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself the path just admitted three mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said  this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the avenue  but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered  no no stay where you are you are charmingly grouped and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth goodbye  she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening    chapter 11   when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawingroom where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared their powers of conversation were considerable they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit  but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned toward darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps he addressed himself to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingleys salutation he was full of joy and attention the first halfhour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace that she might be further from the door he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to anyone else elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight  when tea was over mr hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the cardtablebut in vain she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her mr hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss bennet  miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcys progress through _his_ book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! how much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library  no one made any reply she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said  by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield? i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure  if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chooses before it beginsbut as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards  i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day  much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball  miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said  miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude  elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked up he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere what could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his meaning?and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?  not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it  miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in anything and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives  i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak you either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i would be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire  oh! shocking! cried miss bingley i never heard anything so abominable how shall we punish him for such a speech?  nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth we can all plague and punish one another tease himlaugh at him intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done  but upon my honour i do _not_ i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_ tease calmness of manner and presence of mind! no no i feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject mr darcy may hug himself  mr darcy is not to be laughed at! cried elizabeth that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances i dearly love a laugh  miss bingley said he has given me more credit than can be the wisest and the best of mennay the wisest and best of their actionsmay be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke  certainly replied elizabeththere are such people but i hope i am not one of _them_ i hope i never ridicule what is wise and good follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what you are without  perhaps that is not possible for anyone but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule  such as vanity and pride  yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pridewhere there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation  elizabeth turned away to hide a smile  your examination of mr darcy is over i presume said miss bingley and pray what is the result?  i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect he owns it himself without disguise  no said darcy i have made no such pretension i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little yieldingcertainly too little for the convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offenses against myself my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost forever  _that_ is a failing indeed! cried elizabeth implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault well i really cannot _laugh_ at it you are safe from me  there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evila natural defect which not even the best education can overcome  and _your_ defect is to hate everybody  and yours he replied with a smile is willfully to misunderstand them  do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share louisa you will not mind my waking mr hurst?  her sister had not the smallest objection and the pianoforte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention    chapter 12   in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day but mrs bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish janes week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr bingleys carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made  the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other  the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for herthat she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right  to mr darcy it was welcome intelligenceelizabeth had been at netherfield long enough she attracted him more than he likedand miss bingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for halfanhour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her  on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits  they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother mrs bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth  they found mary as usual deep in the study of thoroughbass and human nature and had some extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married    chapter 13   i hope my dear said mr bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner today because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party  who do you mean my dear? i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call inand i hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her i do not believe she often sees such at home  the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger  mrs bennets eyes sparkled a gentleman and a stranger! it is mr bingley i am sure! well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley butgood lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got today lydia my love ring the belli must speak to hill this moment  it is _not_ mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life  this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once  after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained  about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases  oh! my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned pray do not talk of that odious man i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it  jane and elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail they had often attempted to do it before but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about  it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennet and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself  no that i am sure i shall not and i think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical i hate such false friends why could he not keep on quarreling with you as his father did before him?
